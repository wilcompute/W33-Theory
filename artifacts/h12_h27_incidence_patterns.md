# H12–H27 Incidence Patterns

For each base vertex v0, H12 (neighbors) splits into 4 triangles.
We count how each H27 vertex attaches to these triangles.

## Pattern Distribution (triangle-order independent)

- Uniform across bases: True
- Example distribution (sorted counts):
  - (1, 1, 1, 1): 27

## Pattern Distribution (ordered by triangle index)

- (1, 1, 1, 1): 27

## H27 Degree into H12

- min: 4
- max: 4
- histogram:
  - 4: 1080

## Per-Triangle Attachment Counts (example base)

- Triangle 0: {1: 27}
- Triangle 1: {1: 27}
- Triangle 2: {1: 27}
- Triangle 3: {1: 27}
