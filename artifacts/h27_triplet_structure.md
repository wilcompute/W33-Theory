# H27 Triplet Structure

- Base vertex: v0
- Unique tuples: 9
- Group sizes: [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

## Within-group adjacency
- edges in a group of 3: 0
- edges in a group of 3: 0
- edges in a group of 3: 0
- edges in a group of 3: 0
- edges in a group of 3: 0
- edges in a group of 3: 0
- edges in a group of 3: 0
- edges in a group of 3: 0
- edges in a group of 3: 0

## Between-group adjacency (counts per 3×3 block)
- quotient edges: 36
- quotient degree set: [np.int64(8)]

## Affine F3^2 Coordinates (for the 9 tuples)
- base = (0, 0, 0, 0)
- b1 = [0, 1, 1, 1]
- b2 = [1, 0, 1, 2]

- (0, 0, 0, 0) -> (0, 0)
- (0, 1, 1, 1) -> (1, 0)
- (0, 2, 2, 2) -> (2, 0)
- (1, 0, 1, 2) -> (0, 1)
- (1, 1, 2, 0) -> (1, 1)
- (1, 2, 0, 1) -> (2, 1)
- (2, 0, 2, 1) -> (0, 2)
- (2, 1, 0, 2) -> (1, 2)
- (2, 2, 1, 0) -> (2, 2)
