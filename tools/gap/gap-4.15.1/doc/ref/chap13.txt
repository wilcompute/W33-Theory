  [33X[0;0YEvery  [5XGAP[105X object has a [13Xtype[113X. The type of an object is the information which
  is  used  to decide whether an operation is admissible or possible with that
  object  as  an  argument,  and  if  so,  how  it  is  to  be  performed (see
  Chapter [14X78[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  example,  the types determine whether two objects can be multiplied and
  what  function is called to compute the product. Analogously, the type of an
  object determines whether and how the size of the object can be computed. It
  is  sometimes  useful  in discussing the type system, to identify types with
  the  set  of  objects  that  have  this type. Partial types can then also be
  regarded as sets, such that any type is the intersection of its parts.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  type  of an object consists of two main parts, which describe different
  aspects of the object.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [13Xfamily[113X  determines  the  relation  of  the object to other objects. For
  example,  all  permutations  form  a  family. Another family consists of all
  collections  of  permutations,  this  family contains the set of permutation
  groups  as  a subset. A third family consists of all rational functions with
  coefficients in a certain family.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  other  part  of a type is a collection of [13Xfilters[113X (actually stored as a
  bit-list  indicating,  from  the complete set of possible filters, which are
  included  in this particular type). These filters are all treated equally by
  the  method  selection,  but,  from the viewpoint of their creation and use,
  they  can  be  divided  (with a small number of unimportant exceptions) into
  categories, representations, attribute testers and properties. Each of these
  is described in more detail below.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter does not describe how types and their constituent parts can be
  created. Information about this topic can be found in Chapter [14X79[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[13XNote:[113X  Detailed understanding of the type system is not required to use [5XGAP[105X.
  It  can  be  helpful,  however,  to  understand  how things work and why [5XGAP[105X
  behaves the way it does.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA discussion of the type system can be found in [BL98].[133X
  
  
  [1X13.1 [33X[0;0YFamilies[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe family of an object determines its relationship to other objects.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YMore  precisely,  the families form a partition of all [5XGAP[105X objects such that
  the  following  two  conditions hold: objects that are equal w.r.t. [10X=[110X lie in
  the  same  family; and the family of the result of an operation depends only
  on the families of its operands.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe first condition means that a family can be regarded as a set of elements
  instead of a set of objects. Note that this does not hold for categories and
  representations  (see  below),  two objects that are equal w.r.t. [10X=[110X need not
  lie  in  the  same  categories  and representations. For example, a sparsely
  represented  matrix can be equal to a densely represented matrix. Similarly,
  each  domain  is  equal  w.r.t.  [10X=[110X to the sorted list of its elements, but a
  domain is not a list, and a list is not a domain.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFamilies are probably the least obvious part of the [5XGAP[105X type system, so some
  remarks  about  the  role of families are necessary. When one uses [5XGAP[105X as it
  is,  one  will (better: should) not meet families at all. The two situations
  where families come into play are the following.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFirst,  since  families  are used to describe relations between arguments of
  operations  in  the  method  selection  mechanism  (see Chapter [14X78[114X, and also
  Chapter [14X13[114X),   one   has  to  prescribe  such  a  relation  in  each  method
  installation (see [14X78.3[114X); usual relations are [2XReturnTrue[102X ([14X5.4-1[114X) (which means
  that  any  relation  of  the actual arguments is admissible), [2XIsIdenticalObj[102X
  ([14X12.5-1[114X)  (which  means  that  there  are two arguments that lie in the same
  family),  and  [10XIsCollsElms[110X  (which  means  that there are two arguments, the
  first  being  a  collection  of  elements that lie in the same family as the
  second argument).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSecond  –and  this is the more complicated situation– whenever one creates a
  new  kind of objects, one has to decide what its family shall be. If the new
  object  shall  be  equal  to  existing  objects,  for  example if it is just
  represented  in a different way, there is no choice: The new object must lie
  in  the same family as all objects that shall be equal to it. So only if the
  new  object is different (w.r.t. the equality [21X[10X=[110X[121X) from all other [5XGAP[105X objects,
  we are likely to create a new family for it. Note that enlarging an existing
  family  by  such new objects may be problematic because of implications that
  have been installed for all objects of the family in question. The choice of
  families  depends  on  the applications one has in mind. For example, if the
  new  objects  in  question  are not likely to be arguments of operations for
  which   family   relations  are  relevant  (for  example  binary  arithmetic
  operations), one could create one family for all such objects, and regard it
  as [21Xthe family of all those [5XGAP[105X objects that would in fact not need a family[121X.
  On the other extreme, if one wants to create domains of the new objects then
  one  has  to choose the family in such a way that all intended elements of a
  domain  do  in  fact  lie  in  the same family. (Remember that a domain is a
  collection,  see Chapter [14X12.4[114X, and that a collection consists of elements in
  the same family, see Chapter [14X30[114X and Section [14X13.1[114X.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet  us  look  at  an example. Suppose that no permutations are available in
  [5XGAP[105X,  and that we want to implement permutations. Clearly we want to support
  permutation  groups,  but it is not a priori clear how to distribute the new
  permutations  into  families.  We  can put all permutations into one family;
  this  is  how in fact permutations are implemented in [5XGAP[105X. But it would also
  be possible to put all permutations of a given degree into a family of their
  own;  this  would  for  example  mean  that  for each degree, there would be
  distinguished  trivial  permutations, and that the stabilizer of the point [10X5[110X
  in  the  symmetric group on the points [10X1[110X, [10X2[110X, [22X...[122X, [10X5[110X is not regarded as equal
  to  the  symmetric  group on [10X1[110X, [10X2[110X, [10X3[110X, [10X4[110X. Note that the latter approach would
  have  the  advantage  that  it  is  no problem to construct permutations and
  permutation  groups  acting  on  arbitrary  (finite)  sets,  for  example by
  constructing  first  the  symmetric group on the set and then generating any
  desired permutation group as a subgroup of this symmetric group.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSo  one  aspect  concerning  a  reasonable choice of families is to make the
  families large enough for being able to form interesting domains of elements
  in  the  family.  But on the other hand, it is useful to choose the families
  small  enough  for  admitting  meaningful  relations  between  objects.  For
  example,  the  elements  of  different  free  groups in [5XGAP[105X lie in different
  families;  the  multiplication  of free group elements is installed only for
  the  case that the two operands lie in the same family, with the effect that
  one  cannot  erroneously  form  the  product of elements from different free
  groups.  In  this  case,  families  appear  as  a  tool for providing useful
  restrictions.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  another  example,  note that an element and a collection containing this
  element  never  lie  in  the  same  family, by the general implementation of
  collections;  namely,  the  family of a collection of elements in the family
  [3XFam[103X  is the collections family of [3XFam[103X (see [2XCollectionsFamily[102X ([14X30.2-1[114X)). This
  means  that  for  a collection, we need not (because we cannot) decide about
  its family.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  few  functions in [5XGAP[105X return families, see [2XCollectionsFamily[102X ([14X30.2-1[114X) and
  [2XElementsFamily[102X ([14X30.2-3[114X).[133X

  [33X[1;0Y[29X[2XFamilyObj[102X( [3Xobj[103X ) [32X function[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Yreturns the family of the object [3Xobj[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe   family  of  the  object  [3Xobj[103X  is  itself  an  object,  its  family  is
  [10XFamilyOfFamilies[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  should  be emphasized that families may be created when they are needed.
  For example, the family of elements of a finitely presented group is created
  only  after  the  presentation  has  been constructed. Thus families are the
  dynamic  part  of the type system, that is, the part that is not fixed after
  the initialisation of [5XGAP[105X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFamilies  can  be  parametrized.  For example, the elements of each finitely
  presented  group form a family of their own. Here the family of elements and
  the  finitely  presented  group  coincide  when  viewed  as  sets. Note that
  elements  in  different finitely presented groups lie in different families.
  This  distinction  allows  [5XGAP[105X  to  forbid  multiplications  of  elements in
  different finitely presented groups.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  a  special  case,  families  can  be  parametrized by other families. An
  important  example  is the family of [13Xcollections[113X that can be formed for each
  family.  A collection consists of objects that lie in the same family, it is
  either a nonempty dense list of objects from the same family or a domain.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  every  domain  is  a  collection, that is, it is not possible to
  construct  domains  whose elements lie in different families. For example, a
  polynomial  ring over the rationals cannot contain the integer [10X0[110X because the
  family  that  contains the integers does not contain polynomials. So one has
  to distinguish the integer zero from each zero polynomial.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLet  us  look  at this example from a different viewpoint. A polynomial ring
  and  its coefficients ring lie in different families, hence the coefficients
  ring cannot be embedded [21Xnaturally[121X into the polynomial ring in the sense that
  it  is a subset. But it is possible to allow, e.g., the multiplication of an
  integer  and  a  polynomial  over  the  integers.  The  relation between the
  arguments,  namely that one is a coefficient and the other a polynomial, can
  be  detected from the relation of their families. Moreover, this analysis is
  easier  than  in  a  situation  where  the rationals would lie in one family
  together  with all polynomials over the rationals, because then the relation
  of families would not distinguish the multiplication of two polynomials, the
  multiplication  of two coefficients, and the multiplication of a coefficient
  with a polynomial. So the wish to describe relations between elements can be
  taken as a motivation for the introduction of families.[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[2XNewFamily[102X  returns  a  new  family  [3Xfam[103X with name [3Xname[103X. The argument [3Xreq[103X, if
  present,  is a filter of which [3Xfam[103X shall be a subset. If one tries to create
  an  object  in  [3Xfam[103X that does not lie in the filter [3Xreq[103X, an error message is
  printed.  Also  the argument [3Ximp[103X, if present, is a filter of which [3Xfam[103X shall
  be  a  subset.  Any  object  that  is  created  in  the  family [3Xfam[103X will lie
  automatically in the filter [3Ximp[103X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  filter  [3Xfamfilter[103X,  if given, specifies a filter that will hold for the
  family [3Xfam[103X (not for objects in [3Xfam[103X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFamilies  are always represented as component objects (see [14X79.2[114X). This means
  that components can be used to store and access useful information about the
  family.[133X
  
  
  [1X13.2 [33X[0;0YFilters[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  [13Xfilter[113X is a special unary [5XGAP[105X function that returns either [9Xtrue[109X or [9Xfalse[109X,
  depending  on  whether  or  not  the argument lies in the set defined by the
  filter. Filters are used to express different aspects of information about a
  [5XGAP[105X  object,  which  are  described below (see [14X13.3[114X, [14X13.4[114X, [14X13.5[114X, [14X13.6[114X, [14X13.7[114X,
  [14X13.8[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YPresently  any  filter in [5XGAP[105X is implemented as a function which corresponds
  to  a  set  of positions in the bitlist which forms part of the type of each
  [5XGAP[105X  object,  and returns [9Xtrue[109X if and only if the bitlist of the type of the
  argument has the value [9Xtrue[109X at all of these positions.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe intersection (or meet) of two filters [3Xfilt1[103X, [3Xfilt2[103X is again a filter, it
  can be formed as[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y[3Xfilt1[103X [9Xand[109X [3Xfilt2[103X[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSee [14X20.4[114X for more details.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  example,  [10XIsList  and  IsEmpty[110X  is  a  filter  that returns [9Xtrue[109X if its
  argument  is an empty list, and [9Xfalse[109X otherwise. The filter [2XIsGroup[102X ([14X39.2-7[114X)
  is  defined as the intersection of the category [2XIsMagmaWithInverses[102X ([14X35.1-4[114X)
  and the property [2XIsAssociative[102X ([14X35.4-7[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA  filter  that  is not the meet of other filters is called a [13Xsimple filter[113X.
  For  example,  each  attribute  tester  (see [14X13.6[114X)  is a simple filter. Each
  simple  filter  corresponds  to  a position in the bitlist currently used as
  part of the data structure representing a type.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEvery  filter  has  a [13Xrank[113X, which is used to define a ranking of the methods
  installed  for  an  operation, see Section [14X78.3[114X. The rank of a filter can be
  accessed with [2XRankFilter[102X ([14X13.2-1[114X).[133X

  ([14X13.3-4[114X),  [2XNewRepresentation[102X  ([14X13.4-4[114X),  [2XNewAttribute[102X  ([14X13.5-3[114X), [2XNewProperty[102X
  ([14X13.7-4[114X),  [2XNewFilter[102X ([14X13.8-1[114X). For an arbitrary filter, its rank is given by
  the sum of the incremental ranks of the [13Xinvolved[113X simple filters; in addition
  to  the  implied  filters, these are also the required filters of attributes
  (again  see the sections about the creation of filters). In other words, for
  the  purpose  of  computing  the  rank  and [13Xonly[113X for this purpose, attribute
  testers  are  treated  as  if  they  would  imply  the requirements of their
  attributes.[133X

  [1X13.3 [33X[0;0YCategories[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  [13Xcategories[113X  of  an  object  are  filters (see [14X13.2[114X) that determine what
  operations  an object admits. For example, all integers form a category, all
  rationals  form  a  category, and all rational functions form a category. An
  object  which  claims  to  lie  in  a  certain  category  is  accepting  the
  requirement  that it should have methods for certain operations (and perhaps
  that  their behaviour should satisfy certain axioms). For example, an object
  lying  in  the  category  [2XIsList[102X  ([14X21.1-1[114X)  must  have  methods  for  [2XLength[102X
  ([14X21.17-5[114X),  [2XIsBound\[\][102X  ([14X21.2-1[114X) and the list element access operation [2X\[\][102X
  ([14X21.2-1[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn  object  can lie in several categories. For example, a row vector lies in
  the  categories  [2XIsList[102X  ([14X21.1-1[114X) and [2XIsVector[102X ([14X31.14-14[114X); each list lies in
  the  category  [2XIsCopyable[102X  ([14X12.6-1[114X),  and  depending on whether or not it is
  mutable, it may lie in the category [2XIsMutable[102X ([14X12.6-2[114X). Every domain lies in
  the category [2XIsDomain[102X ([14X31.9-1[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YOf  course some categories of a mutable object may change when the object is
  changed.  For  example,  after  assigning  values  to positions of a mutable
  non-dense  list,  this  list  may  become  part  of the category [2XIsDenseList[102X
  ([14X21.1-2[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YHowever,  if an object is immutable then the set of categories it lies in is
  fixed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAll  categories  in  the  library  are  created  during  initialization,  in
  particular they are not created dynamically at runtime.[133X

  [33X[0;0YEvery object lies in the category [2XIsObject[102X ([14X12.1-1[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  categories  [2XIsExtLElement[102X ([14X31.14-8[114X) and [2XIsExtRElement[102X ([14X31.14-9[114X) contain
  objects  that  can  be multiplied with other objects via [10X*[110X from the left and
  from the right, respectively. These categories are required for the operands
  of the operation [10X*[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe category [2XIsMultiplicativeElement[102X ([14X31.14-10[114X) contains objects that can be
  multiplied  from  the  left  and  from  the right with objects from the same
  family.  [2XIsMultiplicativeElementWithOne[102X  ([14X31.14-11[114X) contains objects [10Xobj[110X for
  which  a multiplicatively neutral element can be obtained by taking the [22X0[122X-th
  power  [10Xobj^0[110X. [2XIsMultiplicativeElementWithInverse[102X ([14X31.14-13[114X) contains objects
  [10Xobj[110X for which a multiplicative inverse can be obtained by forming [10Xobj^-1[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YLikewise,   the   categories   [2XIsExtAElement[102X   ([14X31.14-1[114X),  [2XIsAdditiveElement[102X
  ([14X31.14-3[114X),          [2XIsAdditiveElementWithZero[102X          ([14X31.14-5[114X)         and
  [2XIsAdditiveElementWithInverse[102X ([14X31.14-7[114X) contain objects that can be added via
  [10X+[110X to other objects, objects that can be added to objects of the same family,
  objects  for  which  an  additively  neutral  element  can  be  obtained  by
  multiplication  with  zero, and objects for which an additive inverse can be
  obtained by multiplication with [10X-1[110X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YSo  a  vector  lies  in [2XIsExtLElement[102X ([14X31.14-8[114X), [2XIsExtRElement[102X ([14X31.14-9[114X) and
  [2XIsAdditiveElementWithInverse[102X ([14X31.14-7[114X). A ring element must additionally lie
  in [2XIsMultiplicativeElement[102X ([14X31.14-10[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  stated  above  it is not guaranteed by the categories of objects whether
  the  result  of an operation with these objects as arguments is defined. For
  example,    the   category   [2XIsMatrix[102X   ([14X24.2-1[114X)   is   a   subcategory   of
  [2XIsMultiplicativeElementWithInverse[102X  ([14X31.14-13[114X). Clearly not every matrix has
  a  multiplicative  inverse.  But  the  category [2XIsMatrix[102X ([14X24.2-1[114X) makes each
  matrix  an admissible argument of the operation [2XInverse[102X ([14X31.10-8[114X), which may
  sometimes return [9Xfail[109X. Likewise, two matrices can be multiplied only if they
  are of appropriate shapes.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAnalogous  to the categories of arithmetic elements, there are categories of
  domains of these elements.[133X

  [33X[0;0YOf  course [2XIsDomain[102X ([14X31.9-1[114X) is a subcategory of [2XIsObject[102X ([14X12.1-1[114X). A domain
  that  is  closed under multiplication [10X*[110X is called a magma and it lies in the
  category  [2XIsMagma[102X  ([14X35.1-1[114X). If a magma is closed under taking the identity,
  it  lies  in  [2XIsMagmaWithOne[102X ([14X35.1-2[114X), and if it is also closed under taking
  inverses,   it   lies   in   [2XIsMagmaWithInverses[102X   ([14X35.1-4[114X).   The  category
  [2XIsMagmaWithInversesIfNonzero[102X  ([14X35.1-3[114X) denotes closure under taking inverses
  only for nonzero elements, every division ring lies in this category.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that every set of categories constitutes its own notion of generation,
  for  example  a  group  may  be  generated  as a magma with inverses by some
  elements, but to generate it as a magma with one it may be necessary to take
  the union of these generators and their inverses.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  [13Xrepresentation[113X  of  an  object  is  a  set  of  filters (see [14X13.2[114X) that
  determines how an object is actually represented. For example, a matrix or a
  polynomial  can  be stored sparsely or densely; all dense polynomials form a
  representation. An object which claims to lie in a certain representation is
  accepting  the  requirement  that  certain  fields  in the data structure be
  present and have specified meanings.[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[5XGAP[105X  distinguishes  four  essentially  different  ways to represent objects.
  First  there are the representations [2XIsInternalRep[102X for internal objects such
  as integers and permutations, and [2XIsDataObjectRep[102X for other objects that are
  created  and  whose  data  are accessible only by kernel functions. The data
  structures underlying such objects cannot be manipulated at the [5XGAP[105X level.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAll  other  objects are either in the representation [2XIsComponentObjectRep[102X or
  in the representation [2XIsPositionalObjectRep[102X, see [14X79.2[114X and [14X79.3[114X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn object can belong to several representations in the sense that it lies in
  several     subrepresentations     of     [2XIsComponentObjectRep[102X     or     of
  [2XIsPositionalObjectRep[102X. The representations to which an object belongs should
  form a chain and either two representations are disjoint or one is contained
  in   the  other.  So  the  subrepresentations  of  [2XIsComponentObjectRep[102X  and
  [2XIsPositionalObjectRep[102X  each  form  trees. In the language of Object Oriented
  Programming, we support only single inheritance for representations.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThese trees are typically rather shallow, since for one representation to be
  contained  in  another implies that all the components of the data structure
  implied  by the containing representation, are present in, and have the same
  meaning  in,  the  smaller  representation  (whose data structure presumably
  contains some additional components).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YObjects  may  change  their  representation,  for  example a mutable list of
  characters can be converted into a string.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAll  representations  in  the  library are created during initialization, in
  particular they are not created dynamically at runtime.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YExamples  of  subrepresentations  of [2XIsPositionalObjectRep[102X are [10XIsModulusRep[110X,
  which   is   used   for  residue  classes  in  the  ring  of  integers,  and
  [10XIsDenseCoeffVectorRep[110X,  which  is  used  for  elements  of algebras that are
  defined by structure constants.[133X

  [1X13.5 [33X[0;0YAttributes[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe attributes of an object describe knowledge about it.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn attribute is a unary operation without side-effects.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAn  object  may store values of its attributes once they have been computed,
  and  claim  that  it knows these values. Note that [21Xstore[121X and [21Xknow[121X have to be
  understood  in  the sense that it is very cheap to get such a value when the
  attribute is called again.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  value  returned  by  an  attribute  is in general immutable (see [14X12.6[114X),
  except if the attribute had been specially constructed as [21Xmutable attribute[121X,
  see [2XNewAttribute[102X ([14X13.5-3[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  functions installed as methods for attributes may return mutable
  objects,  the  attribute  returns  the  value  of [2XImmutable[102X ([14X12.6-3[114X) for the
  result. Thus it is recommended that these methods ensure their return values
  are  immutable, e.g., by calling [2XMakeImmutable[102X ([14X12.6-4[114X) if this is possible,
  in order to avoid that [2XImmutable[102X ([14X12.6-3[114X) creates an unnecessary copy of the
  object.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIt  depends  on  the  representation of an object (see [14X13.4[114X) which attribute
  values    it   stores.   An   immutable   object   in   the   representation
  [2XIsAttributeStoringRep[102X  ([14X13.5-5[114X)  stores  [13Xall[113X  attribute values once they are
  computed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  it  is impossible to get rid of a stored attribute value because
  the system may have drawn conclusions from the old attribute value, and just
  removing the value might leave the data structures in an inconsistent state.
  If necessary, a new object can be constructed.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YEach  method  that  is installed for an attribute via [2XInstallMethod[102X ([14X78.3-1[114X)
  must  require  exactly  one argument, and this must lie in the filter [3Xfilter[103X
  that   was  entered  as  second  argument  of  [2XNewAttribute[102X  ([14X13.5-3[114X)  resp.
  [2XNewProperty[102X ([14X13.7-4[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YAs  for  any  operation,  for  attributes one can install a method taking an
  argument  that  does  not  lie in [3Xfilt[103X via [2XInstallOtherMethod[102X ([14X78.3-2[114X), or a
  method for more than one argument. For example, [2XIsTransitive[102X ([14X41.10-1[114X) is an
  attribute for a [22XG[122X-set that can also be called for the two arguments, being a
  group  [22XG[122X  and its action domain. If attributes are called with more than one
  argument then the return value is not stored in any of the arguments.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YProperties  are  a  special  form  of attributes that have the value [9Xtrue[109X or

  [33X[0;0YFor  example, the attribute [2XSize[102X ([14X30.4-6[114X) was created with second argument a
  list  or  a collection, but there is also a method for [2XSize[102X ([14X30.4-6[114X) that is
  applicable to a character table, which is neither a list nor a collection.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  the  optional  third  and  fourth  arguments,  there  are the following
  possibilities.[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YThe  integer  argument  [3Xrank[103X  causes the attribute tester to have this
        incremental rank (see [14X13.2[114X),[133X
  
  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  the  argument [3Xmutable[103X is the string [10X"mutable"[110X or the boolean [9Xtrue[109X,

  [30X    [33X[0;6YIf  the  argument [3Xmutable[103X is the boolean [9Xfalse[109X, then the values of the

  [33X[0;0YWhen  a  value  of  such  mutable attribute is set then this value itself is
  stored,  not an immutable copy of it, and it is the user's responsibility to
  set  an  object that is mutable. This is useful for an attribute whose value
  is  some partial information that may be completed later. For example, there
  is  an  attribute  [10XComputedSylowSubgroups[110X  for  the list holding those Sylow
  subgroups  of  a  group  that  have  been  computed  already by the function
  [2XSylowSubgroup[102X  ([14X39.13-1[114X),  and  this list is mutable because one may want to

  [33X[0;0YAs a consequence, for immutable objects in [2XIsAttributeStoringRep[102X, subsequent

  [33X[0;0Y[13XMutable[113X  objects  in [2XIsAttributeStoringRep[102X are allowed, but attribute values

  they will start storing all attribute values.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that one can force an attribute value to be stored in a mutable object
  in  [2XIsAttributeStoringRep[102X,  by explicitly calling the attribute setter. This
  feature  should  be  used  with care. For example, think of a mutable matrix

  [33X[0;0YThe  normal  behaviour of attributes (when called with just one argument) is

  the  setter  of  the  attribute  is called, to (possibly) store the computed

  [1X13.7 [33X[0;0YProperties[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  properties  of  an  object are those of its attributes (see [14X13.5[114X) whose
  values can only be [9Xtrue[109X or [9Xfalse[109X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  main  difference  between  attributes and properties is that a property
  defines  two  sets of objects, namely the usual set of all objects for which
  the  value is known, and the set of all objects for which the value is known
  to be [9Xtrue[109X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y(Note  that  it  makes  no  sense to consider a third set, namely the set of
  objects  for  which  the  value  of  a property is [9Xtrue[109X whether or not it is
  known,  since  there  may  be  objects for which the containment in this set
  cannot be decided.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  a  property  [3Xprop[103X, the containment of an object [3Xobj[103X in the first set is
  checked  again by applying [10XTester( [3Xprop[103X[10X )[110X to [3Xobj[103X, and [3Xobj[103X lies in the second
  set if and only if [10XTester( [3Xprop[103X[10X )( [3Xobj[103X[10X ) and [3Xprop[103X[10X( [3Xobj[103X[10X )[110X is [9Xtrue[109X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIf a property value is known for an immutable object then this value is also
  stored,  as  part of the type of the object. To some extent, property values
  of  mutable  objects  also  can be stored, for example a mutable list all of
  whose  entries  are  immutable can store whether it is strictly sorted. When
  the  object is mutated (for example by list assignment) the type may need to
  be adjusted.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YImportant  properties  for domains are [2XIsAssociative[102X ([14X35.4-7[114X), [2XIsCommutative[102X
  ([14X35.4-9[114X),   [2XIsAnticommutative[102X   ([14X56.4-6[114X),   [2XIsLDistributive[102X   ([14X56.4-3[114X)   and
  [2XIsRDistributive[102X  ([14X56.4-4[114X), which mean that the multiplication of elements in
  the domain satisfies [22X( a * b ) * c = a * ( b * c )[122X, [22Xa * b = b * a[122X, [22Xa * b = -
  ( b * a )[122X, [22Xa * ( b + c ) = a * b + a * c[122X, and [22X( a + b ) * c = a * c + b * c[122X,

  [1X13.8 [33X[0;0YOther Filters[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YThere  are situations where one wants to express a kind of knowledge that is
  based on some heuristic.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  example,  the  filters (see [14X13.2[114X) [2XCanEasilyTestMembership[102X ([14X39.26-1[114X) and
  [2XCanEasilyComputePcgs[102X ([14X45.2-3[114X) are defined in the [5XGAP[105X library. Note that such
  filters  do not correspond to a mathematical concept, contrary to properties
  (see [14X13.7[114X).  Also  it need not be defined what [21Xeasily[121X means for an arbitrary
  [5XGAP[105X  object,  and in this case one cannot compute the value for an arbitrary
  [5XGAP[105X  object. In order to access this kind of knowledge as a part of the type
  of  an object, [5XGAP[105X provides filters for which the value is [9Xfalse[109X by default,
  and  it is changed to [9Xtrue[109X in certain situations, either explicitly (for the
  given object) or via a logical implication (see [14X78.8[114X) from other filters.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor example, a [9Xtrue[109X value of [2XCanEasilyComputePcgs[102X ([14X45.2-3[114X) for a group means
  that  certain  methods  are  applicable  that  use a pcgs (see [14X45.1[114X) for the
  group.  There  are  logical implications to set the filter value to [9Xtrue[109X for
  permutation  groups  that are known to be solvable, and for groups that have
  already  a  (sufficiently  nice) pcgs stored. In the case one has a solvable
  matrix  group  and  wants to enable methods that use a pcgs, one can set the
  [2XCanEasilyComputePcgs[102X ([14X45.2-3[114X) value to [9Xtrue[109X for this particular group.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YA filter [3Xfilt[103X of the kind described here is different from the other filters
  introduced  in  the previous sections. In particular, [3Xfilt[103X is not a category
  (see [14X13.3[114X) or a property (see [14X13.7[114X) because its value may change for a given
  object,  and  [3Xfilt[103X is not a representation (see [14X13.4[114X) because it has nothing
  to  do  with the way an object is made up from some data. [3Xfilt[103X is similar to
  an  attribute  tester  (see [14X13.6[114X), the only difference is that [3Xfilt[103X does not
  refer  to an attribute value; note that [3Xfilt[103X is also used in the same way as
  an  attribute  tester;  namely,  the  [9Xtrue[109X value may be required for certain
  methods to be applicable.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  order to change the value of [3Xfilt[103X for an object [3Xobj[103X, one can use logical
  implications (see [14X78.8[114X) or [2XSetFilterObj[102X ([14X13.8-3[114X), [2XResetFilterObj[102X ([14X13.8-4[114X).[133X

  [33X[0;0Y[2XNewFilter[102X returns a simple filter with name [3Xname[103X (see [14X13.8[114X).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  optional argument [3Ximplied[103X, if given, must be a filter, meaning that for
  each object in the new filter, also [3Ximplied[103X will be set. Note that resetting
  the  new  filter with [2XResetFilterObj[102X ([14X13.8-4[114X) does [13Xnot[113X reset [3Ximplied[103X. If the
  new filter is intended to be set or reset manually for existing objects then
  the argument [3Ximplied[103X will cause trouble; if the filter is not intended to be
  set  or  reset  manually  then  perhaps calling [2XNewCategory[102X ([14X13.3-4[114X) is more
  appropriate than calling [2XNewFilter[102X.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  optional  argument  [3Xrank[103X denotes the incremental rank (see [14X13.2[114X) of the

  [1X13.9 [33X[0;0YTypes[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  stated  above  (see [14X13[114X) that, for an object [3Xobj[103X, its [13Xtype[113X is formed from
  its  family  and its filters. There is also a third component, used in a few
  situations, namely defining data of the type.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe type of an object is itself an object.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YTwo  types  are  equal  if  and  only if the two families are identical, the

  [33X[0;0YThe  last part of the type, defining data, has not been mentioned before and
  seems  to  be of minor importance. It can be used, e.g., for cosets [22XU g[122X of a
  group  [22XU[122X,  where  the type of each coset may contain the group [22XU[122X as defining
  data.  As  a consequence, two such cosets mod [22XU[122X and [22XV[122X can have the same type
  only  if  [22XU  =  V[122X.  The  defining  data of the type [3Xtype[103X can be accessed via
  [2XDataType[102X.[133X
