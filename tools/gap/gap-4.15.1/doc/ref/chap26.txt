  [33X[0;0YThis  chapter  describes an interface to vector and matrix objects which are
  not represented by plain lists (of plain lists), cf. Chapters [14X23[114X and [14X24[114X.[133X
  
  
  [1X26.1 [33X[0;0YConcepts and Rules for Vector and Matrix Objects[133X[101X
  
  [33X[0;0YTraditionally,  vectors  and matrices in [5XGAP[105X have been represented by (lists
  of)  lists,  see  the  chapters  [14X23[114X  and [14X24[114X. More precisely, the term [21Xvector[121X
  (corresponding  to  the  filter [2XIsVector[102X ([14X31.14-14[114X)) is used in the abstract
  sense of an [21Xelement of a vector space[121X, the term [21Xrow vector[121X (corresponding to
  [2XIsRowVector[102X  ([14X23.1-1[114X))  is  used  to  denote  a  [21Xcoordinate  vector[121X which is
  represented by a [5XGAP[105X list (see [2XIsList[102X ([14X21.1-1[114X)), and the term [21Xmatrix[121X is used
  to  denote  a  list  of  lists,  with  additional  properties  (see [2XIsMatrix[102X
  ([14X24.2-1[114X)).[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YUnfortunately,  such  lists  (objects  in [2XIsPlistRep[102X ([14X21.24-2[114X)) cannot store
  their  type,  and  so it is impossible to use the advantages of [5XGAP[105X's method
  selection  on  them.  This  situation is unsustainable in the long run since
  more  special  representations  (compressed, sparse, etc.) have already been
  and  even more will be implemented. Here we describe a programming interface
  to vectors and matrices, which solves this problem,[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  idea  of this interface is that [5XGAP[105X should be able to represent vectors
  and  matrices  by  objects  that  store their type, in order to benefit from
  method  selection.  These  objects  are  created  by  [2XObjectify[102X ([14X79.1-1[114X), we
  therefore   refer   to  the  them  as  [21Xvector  objects[121X  and  [21Xmatrix  objects[121X
  respectively.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0Y(Of  course the terminology is somewhat confusing: An [21Xabstract matrix[121X in [5XGAP[105X
  can  be  represented either by a list of lists or by a matrix object. It can
  be  detected from the filter [2XIsMatrixOrMatrixObj[102X ([14X26.2-3[114X); this is the union
  of  the  filters  [2XIsMatrix[102X  ([14X24.2-1[114X)  –which denotes those matrices that are
  represented  by  lists  of lists– and the filter [2XIsMatrixObj[102X ([14X26.2-2[114X) –which
  defines  [21Xproper[121X  matrix objects in the above sense. In particular, we do [13Xnot[113X
  regard  the  objects  in  [2XIsMatrix[102X  ([14X24.2-1[114X)  as special cases of objects in
  [2XIsMatrixObj[102X  ([14X26.2-2[114X),  or vice versa. Thus one can install specific methods
  for  all three situations: just for [21Xproper[121X matrix objects, just for matrices
  represented by lists of lists, or for both kinds of matrices. For example, a
  [5XGAP[105X  package may decide to accept only [21Xproper[121X matrix objects as arguments of
  its functions, or it may try to support also objects in [2XIsMatrix[102X ([14X24.2-1[114X) as
  far as this is possible.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YWe  want  to  be  able  to write (efficient) code that is independent of the
  actual  representation  (in  the  sense of [5XGAP[105X's representation filters, see
  Section [14X13.4[114X) and preserves it.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThis  latter requirement makes it necessary to distinguish between different
  representations of matrices: [21XRow list[121X matrices (see [2XIsRowListMatrix[102X ([14X26.2-4[114X)
  behave  basically  like lists of rows, in particular the rows are individual
  [5XGAP[105X  objects  that  can  be shared between different matrix objects. One can
  think   of  other  representations  of  matrices,  such  as  matrices  whose
  subobjects  represent columns, or [21Xflat[121X matrices which do not have subobjects
  like  rows  or  columns  at  all. The different kinds of matrices have to be
  distinguished  already  with respect to the definition of the operations for
  them.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YIn  particular  vector  and  matrix  objects  know  their  base  domain (see
  [2XBaseDomain[102X  ([14X26.3-1[114X))  and their dimensions. The basic condition is that the
  entries  of  vector and matrix objects must either lie in the base domain or
  naturally  embed in the sense that addition and multiplication automatically
  work  with  elements of the base domain; for example, a matrix object over a
  polynomial ring may also contain entries from the coefficient ring.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YVector  and  matrix  objects  may  be  mutable  or  immutable. Of course all
  operations  changing  an  object  are  only  allowed/implemented for mutable
  variants.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YVector  objects are equal with respect to [2X\=[102X ([14X31.11-1[114X) if they have the same
  length  and  the  same  entries. It is not necessary that they have the same
  base  domain.  Matrices  are equal with respect to [2X\=[102X ([14X31.11-1[114X) if they have
  the same dimensions and the same entries.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YFor  a  row  list matrix object, it is not guaranteed that all its rows have
  the  same  vector  type.  It  is  for example thinkable that a matrix object
  stores  some of its rows in a sparse representation and some in a dense one.
  However,  it  is  guaranteed  that  the  rows  of  two  matrices in the same
  representation  are  compatible  in  the  sense  that  all vector operations
  defined  in  this  interface can be applied to them and that new matrices in
  the same representation as the original matrix can be formed out of them.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YNote  that  there is neither a default mapping from the set of matrix object
  representations  to the set of vector representations nor one in the reverse
  direction. There is in general no [21Xassociated[121X vector object representation to
  a    matrix    object    representation    or    vice    versa.    (However,
  [2XCompatibleVectorFilter[102X  ([14X26.3-3[114X) may describe a vector object representation
  that is compatible with a given matrix object.)[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YThe  recommended  way  to  write  code  that  preserves  the  representation
  basically  works by using constructing operations that take template objects
  to decide about the intended representation for the new object.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YVector and matrix objects do not have to be [5XGAP[105X lists in the sense of [2XIsList[102X
  ([14X21.1-1[114X).  Note  that  objects  not  in  the filter [2XIsList[102X ([14X21.1-1[114X) need not
  support  all  list  operations, and their behaviour is not prescribed by the
  rules  for lists, e.g., behaviour w.r.t. arithmetic operations. However, row
  list  matrices  behave nearly like lists of row vectors that insist on being
  dense  and containing only vectors of the same length and with the same base
  domain.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YVector  and  matrix  objects  are not likely to benefit from [5XGAP[105X's immediate
  methods  (see  section  [14X78.7[114X).  Therefore it may be useful to set the filter
  [2XIsNoImmediateMethodsObject[102X ([14X78.7-2[114X) in the definition of new kinds of vector
  and matrix objects.[133X

  [33X[0;0YThe  idea  behind [13Xvector objects[113X is that one wants to deal with objects like

  [33X[0;0YThe  filter  [2XIsMatrixObj[102X alone does [13Xnot[113X imply that the multiplication is the

  filter   [2XIsOrdinaryMatrix[102X   ([14X24.2-2[114X);   this   filter   together   with  the
  associativity  of  the  base domain also implies the associativity of matrix
  multiplication.  For example, elements of matrix Lie algebras (see [2XLieObject[102X

  [33X[0;0YIn  general,  matrix  objects are not lists in the sense of [2XIsList[102X ([14X21.1-1[114X),
  and  they  need  not  behave like lists, that is, they need not obey all the
  rules  for  lists  that are stated in Chapter [14X21[114X. There are situations where
  one wants to have matrix objects that can on the one hand benefit from [5XGAP[105X's
  method selection, as is explained in Section [14X26.1[114X, and do on the other hands
  support  access to [5XGAP[105X objects that represent their rows (which are suitable
  vector  objects).  Matrix  objects  whose  [2XConstructingFilter[102X ([14X26.3-2[114X) value
  implies  [2XIsRowListMatrix[102X  ([14X26.2-4[114X)  support the operations described in this

  a  vector  object  in [2XIsPlistVectorRep[102X ([14X26.15-3[114X). Note that these objects do

  follows.[133X
  
  [33X[0;0YUnbinding  an  entry in a row or unbinding a row in a matrix is allowed only

  [33X[0;0YThe first step in the design of a new type of vector or matrix objects is to
  create  a  new  filter that serves as the [2XConstructingFilter[102X ([14X26.3-2[114X) of the
  new  objects,  see  the  sections  [14X26.15[114X  and  [14X26.16[114X for an overview of such

  [33X[0;0YHere  we  list  those  operations for vector and matrix objects for which no
  default  methods  can be installed. When one implements a new type of vector
  or  matrix  objects  then  one  has to install specific methods at least for
  these  operations,  in order to make the objects behave as described in this
  chapter.  It  is  advisable  to  install  specific  methods  also  for other
  operations,  for  performance  reasons. The installations of default methods
  can  be  found  in the file [11Xlib/matobj.gi[111X of the [5XGAP[105X distribution. There one
  can  check  for which operations it makes sense to overload them for the new
  type  of  vector  or  matrix objects. Note that the specific methods must be
  installed with [2XInstallTagBasedMethod[102X ([14X78.1-6[114X) whenever the default method is
