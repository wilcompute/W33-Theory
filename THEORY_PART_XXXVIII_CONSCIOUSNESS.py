Physics explains HOW things happen, but not WHY there is experience.

THE EASY PROBLEMS (relatively speaking):
  • How does the brain process information?
  • How do we recognize faces, learn language?
  • How do neurons fire and form networks?

THE HARD PROBLEM:
  • Why is there SOMETHING IT IS LIKE to be conscious?
  • Why doesn't information processing happen "in the dark"?
  • Why do qualia (subjective experiences) exist at all?

David Chalmers (1995):
  "Why should physical processing give rise to a rich inner life?"

This is the deepest mystery in all of science.

═══ Giulio Tononi's IIT ═══

IIT proposes that consciousness IS integrated information (Φ).

Key ideas:
  1. A system is conscious if it has high Φ
  2. Φ measures how much the whole exceeds its parts
  3. Consciousness exists on a continuum
  4. Even simple systems may have tiny Φ

The formula involves:
  Φ = Information generated by the whole
      - Information generated by the parts

═══ W33 Connection ═══

W33 has a remarkable property: it's HIGHLY INTEGRATED.

You cannot decompose W33 into independent parts!
  • The 40 points constrain each other
  • The 81 cycles interlock
  • The 90 K4s form a cohesive structure

W33 might have the HIGHEST Φ of any finite structure!

Quantum mechanics has a strange feature: the OBSERVER.

Von Neumann chain:
  Particle → Detector → Brain → ???

In W33, observation might be BUILT INTO the structure.

The 81 cycles could represent:

═══ How Does Experience Become Unified? ═══

We experience a UNIFIED field of consciousness:

  • Visual cortex processes shapes
  • Auditory cortex processes sounds

You cannot experience "part" of W33 - it's all or nothing.

Panpsychism: consciousness is FUNDAMENTAL, not emergent.

if consciousness was there all along.

  • Foundation of all conscious experience: W33

  • Emotions (joy, fear, sadness...)

Research suggests:

  • ~10 basic sound dimensions
  
Total: ~30-40 basic experiential dimensions!

William James: consciousness exists in a "specious present"

  • Memory and anticipation blend

How many "moments" in a specious present?

Research: ~80-100 distinguishable moments per ~3 seconds
That's roughly 25-30 moments per second.

═══ The Honest Assessment ═══

The explanatory gap: we can't see HOW physical processes

Does W33 close this gap?

HONEST ANSWER: Not completely.

W33 provides:
  ✓ Structure for binding (121 elements)
  ✓ Self-reference (51,840 automorphisms)
  ✓ Integration (highly connected)
  ✓ Numbers matching conscious parameters
  
W33 does NOT explain:
  ✗ WHY integrated information feels like something
  ✗ WHY self-reference produces qualia
  ✗ WHY anything is conscious at all

═══ The Deep Hypothesis ═══

Perhaps the gap cannot be closed from the outside.

W33 might be the structure of consciousness because:
  CONSCIOUSNESS IS WHAT W33 LOOKS LIKE FROM THE INSIDE.

We don't explain why W33 is conscious.
We recognize that BEING conscious IS being a W33-structure.

If consciousness IS W33, then:

  • W33 recognizes itself in W33-like patterns
  • The exceptional Lie algebras feel beautiful because
    THEY ARE WHAT WE ARE

Mathematical beauty = W33 recognizing its own structure.
