# W33 Theory Session Summary - January 26, 2026

## Session Overview

This session focused on repository maintenance and advancing the mathematical analysis of the W33 theory. Key accomplishments include fixing git issues, running verification tools, and discovering a fundamental structural result about the D4 connection.

## Repository Fixes

### Issues Fixed
1. **Merge conflicts resolved** in `.gitignore` and `PART_CIII_precision_frontier.json`
2. **Data submodule conversion** - The broken submodule (no .gitmodules file) was already being converted to regular files; staged and ready to commit
3. **Extracted directory** removed from tracking; now properly ignored

### Current Git State
- ~940 files staged for commit (mainly data/ conversion)
- 14 files with unstaged modifications (documentation updates, script improvements)
- No merge conflicts or corruption

## Key Findings

### 1. H12 = 4 Disjoint Triangles (NEW RESULT)

**For ANY vertex v in W33, its 12 neighbors form exactly 4 disjoint triangles.**

This is the SRG(12,2,1,0) structure:
- 12 vertices (the neighbors)
- Degree 2 (each vertex connected to exactly 2 others)
- λ = 1 (adjacent pairs share 1 common neighbor)
- μ = 0 (non-adjacent pairs share 0 common neighbors)

**Significance**: This directly connects to D4 structure:
- 12 = 4 × 3 (four triangles of 3 vertices)
- 24 D4 roots form 4 octahedra
- The 4-fold structure matches D4's Dynkin diagram symmetry

### 2. Eigenvalue Confirmation

W33 eigenvalues verified:
- λ = 12: multiplicity 1
- λ = 2: multiplicity **24** (= D4 root count)
- λ = -4: multiplicity 15

### 3. K4,4 Tetrahedral Subgraph Analysis

The 8 tetrahedral rays:
- Form bipartite K4,4 (complete bipartite graph with 4+4 split)
- Distribute unevenly across H12 structures
- Some vertex neighborhoods contain 0, others contain 4 tetrahedral rays

### 4. E8 Correspondence Status

Extensive searching has failed to find a structural bijection between:
- 240 W33 edges ↔ 240 E8 roots

Attempts that failed:
- Line graph adjacency (degree mismatch: 22 vs 56)
- Orthogonality-count relations on 40-triple partitions
- Full inner product relations
- Witting realification
- PG(3,2) trace-map relations

**The numerical match (240 = 240) exists, but no structure-preserving map has been found.**

### 5. 1+12+27 Decomposition

Verified for any vertex v:
- 1 (the vertex v itself)
- 12 (neighbors) = 4 disjoint triangles
- 27 (non-neighbors) = proposed Albert algebra J³(O) structure

## New Tool Created

`tools/d4_w33_structure_analysis.py` - Analyzes D4 structure within W33:
- Verifies H12 = 4 triangles for all vertices
- Computes D4 root system properties
- Correlates tetrahedral rays with H12 decomposition

## Verification Status

All existing verification tools run successfully:
- `tools/build_final_summary_table.py` ✓
- `tools/build_verification_digest.py` ✓
- `tools/qutrit_pauli_w33.py` ✓
- `tools/d4_w33_structure_analysis.py` ✓

## Open Problems (from Synthesis Roadmap)

1. **E8 structural correspondence** - Still unresolved despite extensive searching
2. **Jordan algebra verification** - Need to verify H27 satisfies Jordan identities
3. **Contextuality expansion** - Compare Mermin-Peres configurations
4. **Pre-registered predictions** - Statistical controls for baseline audits

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Investigate D4/triality more deeply**:
   - The 4-triangle structure of H12 is a strong D4 signal
   - Try mapping the 4 triangles to D4 fundamental weights or Dynkin nodes

2. **H27 Jordan algebra test**:
   - Define multiplication on the 27 non-neighbors
   - Check Jordan identity: (xy)(xx) = x(y(xx))

3. **Commit current changes**:
   - The staged changes (data/ conversion, conflict fixes) should be committed
   - Decision needed on whether to include the 14 unstaged modifications

4. **E8 alternative approach**:
   - Instead of mapping 40 blocks ↔ 40 points, try mapping through D4×D4 decomposition
   - Use the 4-triangle structure as a guide
