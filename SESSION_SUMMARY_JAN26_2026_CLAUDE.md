# W33 Theory Session Summary - January 26, 2026

## Session Overview

This session focused on repository maintenance and advancing the mathematical analysis of the W33 theory. Key accomplishments include fixing git issues, running verification tools, and discovering a fundamental structural result about the D4 connection.

## Repository Fixes

### Issues Fixed
1. **Merge conflicts resolved** in `.gitignore` and `PART_CIII_precision_frontier.json`
2. **Data submodule conversion** - The broken submodule (no .gitmodules file) was already being converted to regular files; staged and ready to commit
3. **Extracted directory** removed from tracking; now properly ignored

### Current Git State
- ~940 files staged for commit (mainly data/ conversion)
- 14 files with unstaged modifications (documentation updates, script improvements)
- No merge conflicts or corruption

## Key Findings

### 1. H12 = 4 Disjoint Triangles (NEW RESULT)

**For ANY vertex v in W33, its 12 neighbors form exactly 4 disjoint triangles.**

This is the SRG(12,2,1,0) structure:
- 12 vertices (the neighbors)
- Degree 2 (each vertex connected to exactly 2 others)
- λ = 1 (adjacent pairs share 1 common neighbor)
- μ = 0 (non-adjacent pairs share 0 common neighbors)

**Significance**: This directly connects to D4 structure:
- 12 = 4 × 3 (four triangles of 3 vertices)
- 24 D4 roots form 4 octahedra
- The 4-fold structure matches D4's Dynkin diagram symmetry

### 2. Eigenvalue Confirmation

W33 eigenvalues verified:
- λ = 12: multiplicity 1
- λ = 2: multiplicity **24** (= D4 root count)
- λ = -4: multiplicity 15

### 3. K4,4 Tetrahedral Subgraph Analysis

The 8 tetrahedral rays:
- Form bipartite K4,4 (complete bipartite graph with 4+4 split)
- Distribute unevenly across H12 structures
- Some vertex neighborhoods contain 0, others contain 4 tetrahedral rays

### 4. E8 Correspondence Status

Extensive searching has failed to find a structural bijection between:
- 240 W33 edges ↔ 240 E8 roots

Attempts that failed:
- Line graph adjacency (degree mismatch: 22 vs 56)
- Orthogonality-count relations on 40-triple partitions
- Full inner product relations
- Witting realification
- PG(3,2) trace-map relations

**The numerical match (240 = 240) exists, but no structure-preserving map has been found.**

### 5. 1+12+27 Decomposition

Verified for any vertex v:
- 1 (the vertex v itself)
- 12 (neighbors) = 4 disjoint triangles
- 27 (non-neighbors) = proposed Albert algebra J³(O) structure

## New Tool Created

`tools/d4_w33_structure_analysis.py` - Analyzes D4 structure within W33:
- Verifies H12 = 4 triangles for all vertices
- Computes D4 root system properties
- Correlates tetrahedral rays with H12 decomposition

## Verification Status

All existing verification tools run successfully:
- `tools/build_final_summary_table.py` ✓
- `tools/build_verification_digest.py` ✓
- `tools/qutrit_pauli_w33.py` ✓
- `tools/d4_w33_structure_analysis.py` ✓

## Open Problems (from Synthesis Roadmap)

1. **E8 structural correspondence** - Still unresolved despite extensive searching
2. **Jordan algebra verification** - Need to verify H27 satisfies Jordan identities
3. **Contextuality expansion** - Compare Mermin-Peres configurations
4. **Pre-registered predictions** - Statistical controls for baseline audits

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Investigate D4/triality more deeply**:
   - The 4-triangle structure of H12 is a strong D4 signal
   - Try mapping the 4 triangles to D4 fundamental weights or Dynkin nodes

2. **H27 Jordan algebra test**:
   - Define multiplication on the 27 non-neighbors
   - Check Jordan identity: (xy)(xx) = x(y(xx))

3. **Commit current changes**:
   - The staged changes (data/ conversion, conflict fixes) should be committed
   - Decision needed on whether to include the 14 unstaged modifications

4. **E8 alternative approach**:
   - Instead of mapping 40 blocks ↔ 40 points, try mapping through D4×D4 decomposition
   - Use the 4-triangle structure as a guide

## Extended Discoveries (Second Pass)

### H27 Jordan Algebra Analysis

The 27 non-neighbors of any vertex form a remarkable structure:

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Vertices | 27 |
| Edges | 108 |
| Regularity | 8-regular |
| Eigenvalues | 8¹, 2¹², -1⁸, -4⁶ |

**Key Finding**: H27 adjacency is COMPLETELY DETERMINED by W33 geometry:
- H27-adjacent ⟺ exactly 2 common W33-neighbors
- H27-non-adjacent ⟺ exactly 4 common W33-neighbors

### D4 Triality / 4-Triangle Deep Structure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Unique triangles | 160 |
| Triangles per base | 4 |
| Triangle sharing | None (each belongs to 1 base) |
| Triangle graph | 160 vertices, 240 edges, 3-regular |
| Inter-triangle edges | 0 (completely disjoint in W33) |

**Geometric Picture**:
```
Base vertex v0
    │
    ├── Triangle T0: {a,b,c} ─┐
    ├── Triangle T1: {d,e,f} ─┼── No edges between triangles
    ├── Triangle T2: {g,h,i} ─┤
    └── Triangle T3: {j,k,l} ─┘
                              │
                              └── Each has 9 neighbors in H27
```

Each H12 vertex is connected to:
- 2 vertices in its own triangle
- 1 base vertex (v0)
- 9 vertices in H27

This completely determines the 12 = 2 + 1 + 9 neighbors!

## Extended Discoveries (Third Pass) - E8 Investigation

### Triangle Graph ↔ E8 Connection

**Key Observation**: The triangle co-occurrence graph has 240 edges = 240 E8 roots!

| Structure | Count |
|-----------|-------|
| Triangle graph vertices | 160 |
| Triangle graph edges | 240 |
| E8 roots | 240 |
| E8 root lines (±pairs) | 120 |

However, the line graph L(T) of the triangle graph has:
- Degree 4 (vs E8 root graph degree 112)
- 480 edges (vs E8's 13440)
- Spectra don't match directly

**But both have eigenvalue 0 with multiplicity 120!**

### D4×D4 Decomposition Analysis

E8 contains D4×D4 structure. Key findings:
- E8 splits as 112 (type 1) + 128 (type 2) roots
- 240 triangle edges = 6 position pairs × 40 bases
- Position pairs group into 3 complementary pairs: (0,1)↔(2,3), (0,2)↔(1,3), (0,3)↔(1,2)

### λ=2 Eigenspace: MAJOR DISCOVERY

The 24-dimensional eigenspace of W33 (eigenvalue λ=2) reveals **clean separation** of adjacency:

**Vertex-level separation:**
| Relationship | Inner Product |
|--------------|---------------|
| Adjacent (W33 edges) | 0.1 (all 240 pairs) |
| Non-adjacent | -0.0667 (all 540 pairs) |

**CLEAN SEPARATION!** Adjacency is completely determined by eigenspace inner product!

**Edge-level separation:**
| Relationship | Inner Products |
|--------------|----------------|
| Adjacent edges (share vertex) | {0.5238, 0.6429} |
| Non-adjacent edges | {-0.1905, -0.0714, 0.0476, 0.2857} |

### Edge Projection Analysis

All 240 W33 edges project to vectors of **identical norm** (1.183216) in the λ=2 eigenspace.

| Property | W33 Edge System | E8 Root System |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Vectors | 240 | 240 |
| Equal norm | ✓ | ✓ |
| Dimension | 24 | 8 |
| Distinct IP values | 6 | 4 |
| Antipodal pairs | 0 | 120 |

The edge projections do NOT form a classical root system (no antipodal pairs, integrality fails), but the structural parallel is significant.

### New Tools Created

- `tools/triangle_e8_correspondence.py` - Investigates 240=240 connection
- `tools/d4_d4_e8_decomposition.py` - D4×D4 decomposition analysis
- `tools/eigenspace_d4_analysis.py` - λ=2 eigenspace structure
- `tools/edge_root_system_analysis.py` - Edge projections as root-like system

### Conclusion on E8

The E8 correspondence remains **unresolved** at the level of explicit bijection, but we found:

1. **Numerical match**: 240 triangle edges = 240 E8 roots
2. **Structural parallel**: Both have equal-norm vectors
3. **Spectral connection**: Shared nullspace dimension 120
4. **Clean separation**: λ=2 eigenspace completely determines adjacency

The connection appears to be through the **24-dimensional eigenspace** rather than through direct graph isomorphism. The eigenvalue-2 multiplicity matching D4 root count (24) suggests the fundamental link is at the D4 level, with E8 emerging through higher structure
