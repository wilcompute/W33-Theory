# Axis protection + generated group summary (2026-01-10)

- Incidence automorphisms (tomotope 12-point / 15-line): |G_inc| = 12
- Added D8 axis-stabilizer element (order-2 lift): generated group on 27 hyperplane phase-functions: |G_ext| = 108

## Key computed facts
1) The 15 tomotope rainbow lines correspond to 15 of the 27 hyperplane phase-functions (indices: 2 3 7 11 12 16 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26).
2) Under incidence group (order 12), the tomotope 15 split into orbits of sizes 6, 6, 3 on the 15-line set; equivalently they occupy 3 orbits inside the 27-phase-function action.
3) Adding the single D8 axis-stabilizer (element_id=1) generates the full 27-phase-function universe from the tomotope 15: the closure equals all 27.
4) In the generated group of order 108, the 27 phase-functions split into two invariant blocks:
   - a block of size 18 consisting of all points with sec0-phase m0 ∈ {0,1} (mixed),
   - a block of size 9 consisting of all points with sec0-phase m0 = 2.
   This 9-block is the strongest ‘axis-protected’ core: it is a full orbit under the 108-group, and the tomotope 15 contains it completely.
