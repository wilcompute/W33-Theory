# TOE continuation: tomotope15, hyperplane27, and the 1296-symmetry closure

## What was computed (from the uploaded CSVs)

1. The **tomotope→W(3,3)** matched set gives **15 rainbow quartets** on the 12 projective classes `sec3_m`.
2. Those 15 quartets sit inside the full **27-element** affine hyperplane of phase-functions
   \[
   a_0-a_1-a_2+a_3\equiv 1\pmod 3,
   \]
   via \(m_0=a_0\), \(m_1=a_0+a_1\), \(m_2=a_0+a_2\), \(m_3=a_0+a_1+a_2+a_3\).

## Exact groups computed

### Incidence automorphisms of the (12 points, 15 lines) configuration
- Size: **12**
- Structure: **D6** (dihedral group of order 12)
- Action on the 15 lines has orbit decomposition: **6 + 6 + 3**
  - the size-6 orbit that contains **all lines with sec0_m0 or sec0_m1**
  - two orbits of sec0_m2-lines (sizes 6 and 3)

### Liftable doily subgroup on the 27 hyperplane phase-functions
- D8 (order 8) acting on the 27 phase-functions via Z3-linear lifts.

### Combined closure on the 27 hyperplane phase-functions
- Generated by **D8 lifts** and the **D6 incidence action**.
- Size: **1296**.
- Acts **transitively** on the 27 phase-functions.
- Stabilizer of the tomotope15 subset (as a set) is exactly the incidence D6 subgroup (size 12), so there are **108** tomotope15-equivalent configurations inside the 27-hyperplane.

## Why this matters for “taking it all the way”

This is now a **fully explicit finite symmetry machine**:
- A 27-state affine phase-function space (Z3 hyperplane),
- A liftable “doily” subgroup (D8) and an incidence subgroup (D6),
- A combined 1296-element closure acting transitively.

The next TOE-grade step is to couple this symmetry machine to the **orbit-0 flipgraph transport** (2T/Z24 clock) and to the **defect-localized spectral families** (Particle Families):
- interpret the D6 orbits of rainbow lines as **distinct transport channels**,
- interpret the D8 lifts as **clock-gauge frame changes** that are invisible in the tomotope selection but visible in the 27-universe,
- and measure which subgroup actions preserve the Z2 curvature cocycle (defect parity) versus those that do not.
