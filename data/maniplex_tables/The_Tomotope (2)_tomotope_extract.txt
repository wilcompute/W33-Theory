The Tomotope
tomotope Tis a small, highly involved, abstract uniform 4-polytope. It
we come to the tomotope , a most peculiar uniform 4-polytope T, constructed
4 The Tomotope T
The resulting group Γ(Ut;ho)has order 192but still satisﬁes the intersection con-
Example 4.3. The tomotope .
Denition 4.4. We shall call the resulting uniform 4-polytope Tthe tomotope.
The tomotope has 4 vertices, 12 edges, 16 triangles, 4 tetrahedra and 4
Moreover, R2is a minimal regular cover for the tomotope T.
4.1 Aside: visualizing the tomotope
To visualize the tomotope Timagine a core octahedron with 8 tetrahedra glued

Since the tomotope Twas constructed as a quotient of the uniform Euclidean
In order to connect the regular polytopes Pkto the tomotope T, we shall
Theorem 5.9. Letp; q > 1be coprime odd integers. Then the tomotope T
It is clear now that the tomotope must have inﬁnitely many distinct minimal
Surely this sort of multiplicity of minimal regular covers for the tomotope is
the tomotope in another natural way.
The incidence information for the faces of the tomotope is summarized in Fig-

To see that the edges and triangles of the tomotope are arranged in exactly
is a split extension of the tomotope group Γ(T)by a dihedral group of order 6.
of course be nice to have a more insightful explanation for why the tomotope
