Symmetry  typeAbstract  polytopes are a combinatorial  generalization  of convex  and skeletal  polytopes.
Counting  how many ﬂag orbits a polytope  has under its automorphism  group is a way
of measuring  how symmetric  it is. Polytopes  with one ﬂag orbit are called regularand are
very well known.  Polytopes  with two ﬂag orbits (called  2-orbit  polytopes ) are, however,  way
more elusive.  There are 2n−1 possible  classes  of 2-orbit  polytopes  in rank (dimension)  n,
but for most of those classes,  determining  whether  or not they are empty  is still an open
problem.  In 2019, in their article  An existence  result on two-orbit  maniplexes , Pellicer,  Potoˇcnik
and Toledo  constructed  2-orbit  maniplexes (objects  that generalize  abstract  polytopes  and
maps) in all these classes,  but the question  of whether  or not they are also polytopes
remained  open. In this paper we use the results  of a previous  paper by the author  and
Hubard  to show that some of these 2-orbit  maniplexes  are, in fact, polytopes.  In particular
we prove that there are 2-orbit  polytopes  in all the classes  where  exactly  two kinds of
reﬂections  are forbidden.  We use this to show that there are at least n2−n +1 classes
of 2-orbit  polytopes  of rank nthat are not empty.  We also show that the maniplexes
constructed  with this method  in the remaining  classes  satisfy  all but (possibly)  one of
the properties  necessary  to be polytopes,  therefore  we get closer to proving  that there are
2-orbit  polytopes  in all the classes.

1. Introduction
Abstract  polytopes  are posets  with some properties  that generalize  those of the face poset of convex  and skeletal
polytopes.  Since their introduction  by Schulte  in [4], the main approach  to study abstract  polytopes  has been by their
symmetries.  It is known  that the group  of symmetries  (or automorphism  group)  of an abstract  polytope  acts freely  on its
ﬂags: chains  consisting  of one element  of each rank (dimension).  Therefore,  we may measure  how symmetric  a polytope
is by counting  how many ﬂag orbits  it has under  the action  of its automorphism  group.  A k-orbit  polytope is one that has
kﬂag orbits  under  this action.  The smaller  the number  of ﬂag orbits,  the more symmetric  the polytope.  We call 1-orbit
polytopes  regular, and they have been by far the most studied.  The book [10]i s the standard  reference  and it is dedicated
solely  to abstract  regular  polytopes.
It is quite clear that 2-orbit  polytopes  are the second  most symmetric  kind of polytopes  after the regular  ones, so,
naturally,  they have been the second  most studied  family.  Nevertheless,  the general  theory  of 2-orbit  polytopes  has been
much more challenging  than that of regular  ones.
One can classify  2-orbit  polytopes  of rank nin 2n−1d i f f e r e n t  symmetry  types. These  symmetry  types are determined
by a proper  subset  I⊂{0, 1, ..., n −1}, that in some way consists  of the “permitted  kinds of reﬂections”;  the symmetry

type associated  with Iis denoted  by 2n
I. One of those symmetry  types consists  of the so called  chiralpolytopes:  those
with all possible  “rotational”  symmetry  but no “reﬂection”  symmetry  at all (2n
∅). Historically,  chiral polytopes  have been the
most studied  type of 2-orbit  polytopes.  The main theory  of (abstract)  chiral polytopes  was developed  in 1991 by Schulte
and Weiss [18]b u t the existence  of chiral polytopes  in any rank was one of the main questions  to consider.  Rank 3 chiral
polytopes  had been studied  in the context  of maps on surfaces,  and in the 1970’s  Coxeter  gave examples  of rank 4 chiral
polytopes  arising  as quotients  of hyperbolic  tessellations [ 2]. However,  it is not until 2008 that algebraic  methods  were
developed  to ﬁnd (ﬁnite)  chiral polytopes  of rank 5[1]. In 2010, almost  20 years after the publication  of [18], Pellicer
proved  that there exist abstract  chiral polytopes  in any rank greater  than 2[14].
Also in 2010, Hubard [ 7]d e s c r i b e d  a way to construct  2-orbit  polyhedra  of any symmetry  type from groups;  examples
of 2-orbit  polyhedra  for each of the 7 possible  symmetry  types are well-known.  In 2016, Pellicer [ 15]f o u n d  geometric
examples  of 2-orbit  polytopes  of any rank with a ﬁxed symmetry  type. However,  the challenge  of ﬁnding  2-orbit  polytopes
of any possible  type has not had that much of an advancement.
Maniplexes are a generalization  of polytopes  where  some conditions  on connectivity  are relaxed.  In 2019, Pellicer,
Potoˇcnik and Toledo [ 16]f o u n d  a way to construct  2-orbit  maniplexes  of any type. To do this, they used a voltage  as-
signment on the symmetry-type  graph.  However,  the question  of whether  or not their examples  are ﬂag graphs  of polytopes
remained  open. This is due to the fact that there was no method  to ﬁnd the intersection  properties  that the so called
voltage  group  should  satisfy  for the derived  maniplex  to be polytopal.  However,  in [8], Hubard  and the author  of this paper
described  a method  to ﬁnd the intersection  properties  for every symmetry  type for any number  of orbits  (see Theorem 3.2).
Using  this method  for 2-orbit  maniplexes,  we have a way to test and determine  their polytopality.
The 2-orbit  n-maniplexes  constructed  in [16] depend  on some choices:  a regular  (n −1)-maniplex  and a monodromy
(to be deﬁned  in Section 2) of that maniplex,  both satisfying  some conditions.  In their paper,  Pellicer,  Potoˇcnik and Toledo
proved  that given a 2-vertex  symmetry  type, there exists  a maniplex  Mand a monodromy  ηof Msatisfying  such condi-
tions and thus, the n-maniplex  obtained  has the desired  symmetry-type  graph.  In this paper  we shall show that some of
the maniplexes  constructed  in [16]a r e in fact polytopal.  More speciﬁcally,  we shall see that if {0, 1, ..., n −1} \Ihas exactly
two elements,  there are choices  for the maniplex  Mand the monodromy  ηthat ensure  that the maniplex  constructed
in [16]w i t h  symmetry  type 2n
Iis polytopal.
The ﬁrst sections  of this paper  will introduce  all the concepts  that we will use. In Section2we deﬁne  the basic concepts
such as abstract  polytopes,  ﬂags, maniplexes,  premaniplexes,  automorphisms,  symmetry-type  graphs,  monodromies and coverings .
In Section3we deﬁne  the concepts  of fundamental  groupoid and fundamental  groupof a graph,  voltage  graphs,  derived  graphs,
and we enunciate  Theorem 3.2, which  will be our main tool. In Section 4we describe  the construction  ˆ2M, which  gives
rise to a family  of regular  polytopes  of all ranks that we will be using for all our examples.  In Section 5we describe  the
construction  given in [16]t o get 2-orbit  maniplexes,  and we also add some observations  that will be helpful  when proving
the main result.  Finally,  in Section6we use this construction  and Theorem 3.2to prove that if Ihas exactly  n −2 elements,
then there exists  a polytope  Pwith symmetry  type 2n
I.
2. Basic concepts
An abstract  polytope is deﬁned  as a poset (P, ≤)that is ﬂagged,  strongly  ﬂag-connected  and satisﬁes  the diamond  prop-
erty. We clarify  each of these properties  now:
A poset is ﬂaggedif it has a least element  F−1, a greatest  element  Fn, and all maximal  chains,  called  ﬂags, have the
same ﬁnite size. If the size of the ﬂags is n +2, we say that the ﬂagged  poset has rank n. Moreover,  given an element  F
of a ﬂagged  poset,  if the maximal  chains  having  Fas their biggest  element  have r+2 elements,  we say that Fhas rank
rand write rank(F) =r. For the purposes  of this paper,  an element  of rank iwill be called  an i-face, and in general,  the
elements  of a ﬂagged  poset will be called  faces. The (n −1)-faces  in a ﬂagged  poset of rank nare called  facets. If /Phi1is a ﬂag,
we denote  its face of rank iby (/Phi1)i.
We say that a ﬂagged  poset satisﬁes  the diamond  condition if given two faces F, Gsuch that F<Gand rank(G) −
rank(F) =2, there exist exactly  two faces H1, H2such that F<Hi<Gfor i ∈{1, 2}. We say that two ﬂags /Phi1and /Psi1in
a ﬂagged  poset are i-adjacent if they have the same faces with ranks different  than ibut they have different  i-faces.  If
a ﬂagged  poset satisﬁes  the diamond  condition,  every ﬂag /Phi1has exactly  one i-adjacent  ﬂag for i ∈{0, 1, ..., n −1}. The
unique  ﬂag i-adjacent  to /Phi1is denoted  /Phi1i.
We say that a ﬂagged  poset is strongly  ﬂag-connected if given two ﬂags /Phi1, /Psi1, there is a sequence  /Phi10=/Phi1, /Phi11, /Phi12, ...,
/Phi1k=/Psi1, such that /Phi1j−1and /Phi1jare ij-adjacent  for some ijsatisfying  that /Phi1and /Psi1have different  ij-faces.
From now on, we will refer to abstract  polytopes  just as polytopes . We will also abuse  notation  and call Pan abstract
polytope  assuming  that the symbol  ≤will be used for the order relation  (and <for the strict order relation).  A polytope  of
rank nis called  an n-polytope .
Given  a polytope  P, the ﬂag graph of P, denoted  G(P), is the edge-colored  graph  whose  vertices  are the ﬂags of P
and i-adjacent  ﬂags are joined  by an edge of color i. The ﬂag graph  of an n-polytope  is an example  of what is called  an
n-maniplex or a maniplex  of rank n. That is, a connected  simple  graph  with edges  colored  with the numbers  {0, 1, ..., n −1},
in such a way that:
•every vertex  is incident  to an edge of each color, and
2
E. Mochán Discrete Mathematics 347 (2024) 114055
•given two colors  iand jsuch that |i −j| >1, the alternating  paths of length  4 using edges  of these two colors  are
closed.
The vertices  of a maniplex  are usually  referred  to as ﬂags.
At this point,  we point out that although  inﬁnite  maniplexes  and polytopes  can be very interesting,  for the purposes  of
this paper,  all maniplexes  and polytopes  are assumed  to be ﬁnite.  Some of the results  and deﬁnitions  may also apply for
the inﬁnite  case, but not all of them (particularly,  the main deﬁnition  of Section 4needs  some ﬁne-tuning  for the inﬁnite
case).
Given  a set of colors  I⊂{0, 1, ..., n −1}, and an n-maniplex  M, we use the notation  MIfor the subgraph  of Minduced
by the edges  with colors  in I. We will denote  the complement  of Iin {0, 1, ..., n −1}by I, and if I={i}, we denote  its
complement  just by i. The connected  components  of Miare the i-faces  of M.
We say that an i-face Fand a j-face Gof a maniplex  are incident if they have non-empty  intersection.  If in addition
i ≤j, we write F≤G.
In this way we have deﬁned  a poset P(M). If Pis a polytope,  then P(G(P))is isomorphic  to P. On the other hand,
in [6]i t is proven  that if Msatisﬁes  certain  conditions  called  path intersection  properties , then P(M)is a polytope  and
G(P(M))is isomorphic  to M, showing  that such maniplexes,  called  polytopal , are exactly  the ﬂag graphs  of polytopes.
An isomorphism of n-maniplexes  is just a graph  isomorphism  that preserves  the colors  of the edges.  Naturally,  an au-
tomorphism  of a maniplex  is just an isomorphism  onto itself. The automorphism  group  of a maniplex  Mis denoted  by
/Gamma1(M). It is known  that the automorphism  group  of a maniplex  acts freely  on its ﬂags (the proof is identical  to that of [10,
Proposition 2A4],  which  is the particular  case of abstract  polytopes).  Moreover,  the automorphisms  of the ﬂag graph  of a
polytope  correspond  to the automorphisms  of the polytope  itself (as a poset)  (see [10, Lemma 2A3] for  one inclusion.  The
other inclusion  can be proved  using the construction  in [6, Section 3]).
The symmetry-type  graph (STG)of a maniplex  M, denoted  by T(M), is simply  the quotient  of Mby its automorphism
group.  That is, the vertices  of T(M)are the ﬂag orbits  of Munder  its automorphism  group,  and two orbits  are connected
by an edge of color iif there is a pair of i-adjacent  ﬂags, one in each of those orbits.  If two i-adjacent  ﬂags are on the same
orbit, we draw a semiedge  of color ion the vertex  corresponding  to that orbit. Notice  that T(M)is not necessarily  simple,
but it satisﬁes  the other conditions  that deﬁne  an n-maniplex:  it is connected,  each vertex  is incident  to exactly  one edge
of each color in {0, 1, ..., n −1}, and the alternating  paths of length  4 using two non-consecutive  colors  are closed.  We call
such a graph  an n-premaniplex , or just a premaniplex if the rank nis implicit.
The symmetry-type  graphof a polytope  Pis just the symmetry-type  graph  of its ﬂag graph,  and it is denoted  by T(P).
A k-orbit  polytope  (or maniplex) is one with exactly  kﬂag orbits  under  the action  of its automorphism  group.  In other
words,  one whose  symmetry-type  graph  has exactly  kvertices.  A 1-orbit  polytope  (or maniplex)  is called  regular.
Given  a maniplex  M, we deﬁne  rias the ﬂag permutation  that maps each ﬂag to its i-adjacent  ﬂag. It is easy to see
that riis an involution  and that, if |i −j| >1, then rirjis also an involution.  In particular  riand rjcommute  whenever  i
and jare not consecutive.
The group  Mon(M) =/angbracketleftri:0 ≤i ≤n −1/angbracketrightis called  the monodromy  group of M, and we will call each of its elements
a monodromy . It is worth  mentioning  that some authors  prefer  the term connection  groupand the notation  Con(M). An
alternative  way of deﬁning  the automorphism  group  of a maniplex  Mis as the set of ﬂag permutations  that commute  with
the elements  of the monodromy  group.
For this paper,  both the automorphism  and the monodromy  group  will act on the right.
If Mis a regular  maniplex  (sometimes  called  reﬂexible ), for a ﬁxed ﬂag /Phi1we can deﬁne  ρias the (unique)  automor-
phism  that maps /Phi1to /Phi1i. It is known  that {ρi:0 ≤i ≤n −1}is a generating  set for the automorphism  group  of M(see [10,
Theorem  2B8] for  the polytopal  case). Moreover,  the function  mapping  ρito rican be extended  to a group  anti-isomorphism
between  /Gamma1(M)and Mon(M)(see, for example, [ 12, Theorem 3.9] or [ 20, Section 7]).  In particular,  the monodromy  group
of a regular  maniplex  acts regularly  on its ﬂags.
Given  two n-premaniplexes  Mand X, a covering  projection (covering for short)  from Mto X, is a function  pfrom the
vertices  of Mto the vertices  of Xthat preserves  i-adjacencies.  It can be proved  that all coverings  are surjective.  If eis an
edge Mconnecting  vertices  xand y, we deﬁne  p(e)as the edge connecting  p(x)and p(y)that has the same color as e.
If there is a covering  from Mto X, we say that Mcovers  X. Note that if Mis a maniplex  and Xis its symmetry-type
graph,  the natural  projection  from Mto Xis always  a covering.
3. Voltage  graphs  and intersection  properties
A dartin a graph  is just a directed  edge. The inverseof a dart d, denoted  by d−1is the dart that corresponds  to the
same edge with the opposite  orientation.  We think of semiedges as having  only one orientation,  having  thus only one dart
which  is inverse  to itself. An edge with two different  endpoints  (and therefore,  with two different  darts)  will be called  a
link. Every dart dhas an initial vertex, or startpoint I (d), and a terminal  vertexor endpoint T (d), having  the property  that
its underlying  edge is incident  to both I(d)and T(d), and that I(d−1) =T(d)and T(d−1) =I(d). For more on graphs  with
semiedges  see [9], for example.

A pathis a sequence  of darts W=d1d2···dk, such that T(di) =I(di+1)for every i <k. We say that W goes  from u( i t s
startpoint)  to v( i t s endpoint) if u =I(d1)and v =T(dk). We say that a path is closedif its startpoint  and endpoint  are equal.
Otherwise,  it is open.
We also consider  a formal  empty  path for each vertex  that goes from that vertex  to itself. If Wis the empty  path from
vto v, we abuse  notation  and denote  it by vas well.
Two paths Wand W/primewith the same startpoint  and endpoint  are said to be homotopic if one can transform  Winto W/prime
by a ﬁnite sequence  of the following  operations:
•Inserting  two consecutive  inverse  darts at any point,  that is
d1d2···didi+1···dk/mapsto→d1···didd−1di+1···dk,
where  I(d) =T(di);
•Deleting  two consecutive  inverse  darts at any point,  that is
d1···didd−1di+1···dk/mapsto→d1d2···didi+1···dk;
In this case we write W∼W/prime.
It is known  that homotopy  is an equivalence  relation  and that it is preserved  by the usual concatenation  of paths.  We
often abuse  notation  and use Was the name for a path or for its homotopy  class. Furthermore,  even if we refer to Was a
path, we will always  be thinking  of it up to homotopy.
The set of all homotopy  classes  of paths in a graph  X, together  with the concatenation  operation  forms  a groupoid
called  the fundamental  groupoid  of X, which  we will denote  by /Pi1(X). The subset  of closed  paths based  at a vertex  xforms
a group  denoted  by /Pi1x(X)and called  the fundamental  group of Xb a s e d  at x. It is easy to show that if Xis connected,  all its
fundamental  groups  are isomorphic  (moreover,  they are conjugates  by elements  of the fundamental  groupoid).
Given  a spanning  tree Tand a vertex  of a graph  Xwe can ﬁnd a distinguished  set of generators  for the fundamental
group  /Pi1x(X). For each dart din Xbut not in T, take the path Cdthat goes from xto the starting  point of dthrough  T,
then takes d, and then goes back to xfrom the endpoint  of dtrough  T. It is easy to see that /Pi1x(X)is generated  by {Cd},
where  druns among  the darts in Xnot in T.
Given  a graph  Xand a group  /Gamma1, a voltage  assignment  (with voltage  group /Gamma1)is a groupoid  antimorphism  ξ:/Pi1(X) →/Gamma1.
The pair (X, ξ)is called  a voltage  graph.
To construct  a voltage  assignment,  it is enough  to deﬁne  it for the darts of X(in such a way that inverse  darts have
inverse  voltages).  Then, the voltage  of the path W=d1d2, ···dkis simply  ξ(dk) ···ξ(d2)ξ(d1).
Note that ξ(/Pi1x(X)) =/angbracketleft {ξ(Cd)}d/angbracketright, where  druns among  the darts of the graph  Xnot in a given spanning  tree T. This will
be important  later, since very often we want to know the voltages  of some sets of closed  paths.  Knowing  the voltages  of
a fundamental  group  will also help us calculate  the set of voltages  of open paths with ﬁxed startpoint  and endpoint  as a
coset of the voltages  of a fundamental  group.
Given  a voltage  graph  (X, ξ)with voltage  group  /Gamma1, we can construct  the derived  graph Xξas follows:
•The vertex  set is V×/Gamma1where  Vis the vertex  set of X.
•The dart set is D ×/Gamma1where  Dis the dart set of X.
•If the dart dgoes from xto y, the dart (d, γ)goes from the vertex  (x, γ)to (y, ξ(d)γ).
•(Optional)  If a dart (or vertex)  dhas a color c, then the dart (or vertex)  (d, γ)also has color c.
Note that the inverse  of the dart (d, γ)is the dart (d−1, ξ(d)γ).
The voltage  group  /Gamma1always  acts by automorphisms  on the derived  graph  Xξ, with the action  given by (x, γ)σ=(x, γσ),
where  xis a dart or vertex  of Xand γ, σ∈/Gamma1. It should  also be clear that if Xhas some coloring  of its vertices  or darts,
then /Gamma1preserves  the induced  coloring  when acting  on Xξ.
In [8], Hubard  and the author  of this paper  prove the following  results:
Lemma  3.1. [8, Lemma 3.1] Let Xbe a premaniplex  and ξ:/Pi1(X) →/Gamma1a voltage  assignment  such that Xhas a spanning  tree with
trivial  voltage  on all its darts. Then Xξis a maniplex  if and only if the following  conditions  hold:
•The set ξ(D)generates  /Gamma1where  Di s the set of darts of X.
•If di s the dart of a semiedge,  then ξ(d)has order exactly  two.
•If da n d d/primeshare both their startpoint  and their endpoint,  then ξ(d) /negationslash=ξ(d/prime).
•If |i −j| >1every (closed)  path Wo f length  4 whose  darts alternate  between  these two colors has trivial  voltage.
Before  giving  the next result  we need to introduce  some notation.  Given  two integers  kand mwe deﬁne  [k, m] :=
{k, k +1, ..., m}. If k >m, then we deﬁne  [k, m]as the empty  set. If Xis an n-premaniplex,  aand bare two vertices  in X,
and I⊂[0, n −1], then we deﬁne  /Pi1a,b
I(X)as the subset  of /Pi1(X)consisting  of all the paths from ato bthat only use darts
with colors  in I. In particular,  /Pi1a,b
[k,m](X)is the set of paths from ato bthat only use colors  between  kand m.

Theorem  3.2. [8, Theorem 4.2] Let Xbe a premaniplex  of rank na n d ξ:/Pi1(X) →/Gamma1a voltage  assignment.  Then Xξis polytopal  if
and only if it is a maniplex  and the following  equation  holds for all k, m ∈{0, 1, ..., n −1}and all pairs of vertices  a, b ∈X:
ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m](X))∩ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n−1](X))=ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,m](X)). (1)
In this paper  we will use Theorem 3.2to show that we can construct  2-orbit  polytopes  with some prescribed  symmetry-
type graphs.
4. The construction  ˆ2M
The main theorem  in [16]( T h e o r e m3 )  states  that every premaniplex  with exactly  two vertices  is the symmetry-type
graph  of a maniplex  /tildewiderM. To prove this, given a regular  maniplex  Mof rank nwith some conditions,  and a premaniplex
Xof rank n +1w i t h  2 vertices,  the authors  deﬁne  a voltage  assignment  ξon Xthat gives a 2-orbit  maniplex  /tildewiderMwith
symmetry-type  graph  X. The voltage  group  is a group  acting  on the set MW×Z2/lscript, where  MWconsists  of a speciﬁc  half
of the ﬂags of Mand /lscript(called  kin the original  paper)  is a natural  number  (usually  very large).
To be more precise,  the conditions  on Mare (equivalent  to) the following:
1.Mhas to cover Xn(the premaniplex  of rank nobtained  by deleting  the edges  of color nfrom X).1
2. There  is an involutory  monodromy  ηin Mthat maps all the ﬂags of any given facet to different  facets.
A concrete  family  of maniplexes  satisfying  these conditions  is given and its elements  are called  Mnwhere  ndenotes
the rank. This family  is constructed  recursively  and it does not depend  on the choice  of X. More concretely,  M2is the ﬂag
graph  of the square,  and Mn+1is constructed  from Mnas ˆ2M n(which  we will deﬁne  shortly).  In [13]i t is proved  that if
Pis a regular  polytope  then ˆ2G(P)is the ﬂag graph  of a regular  polytope,  and we will see shortly  a proof of the fact that
if Mis regular  ˆ2Mis regular  too. This implies  that the family  {Mn}n≥2consists  of ﬂag graphs  of regular  polytopes.  Since
there are known  examples  of 2-orbit  polyhedra  (rank 3) with any given symmetry-type,  we are only concerned  about  the
family  {Mn}n≥3, which  are the maniplexes  used to construct  2-orbit  maniplexes  of ranks 4 and higher.
The construction  ˆ2Mworks  as follows:  Given  a maniplex  M, the ﬂags of ˆ2Mare F(M) ×ZFac(M)
2, where  F(M)is
the set of ﬂags of Mand Fac(M)is the set of facets.  We will think of ZFac(M)
2as the set of functions  from Fac(M)to the
cyclic group  Z2, or equivalently,  vectors  with one entry in Z2associated  to each element  of Fac(M). Then the adjacencies
in ˆ2Mare deﬁned  by:
(/Phi1,x)i:=(/Phi1i,x)ifi<n,
(/Phi1,x)n:=(/Phi1,x+χFac(/Phi1)),
where  Fac(/Phi1)denotes  the facet of /Phi1and given a facet F∈Fac(M)the vector  χFis the one associated  with the character-
istic function  of F, that is, the vector  with 1 in the coordinate  corresponding  to Fand 0 in every other one.
If we remove  the edges  of color nfrom ˆ2Mwe get one connected  component  for each vector  x ∈ZFac(M)
2. Each compo-
nent consists  of all ﬂags of type (/Phi1, x)where  /Phi1is a ﬂag of M. In particular,  every facet of ˆ2Mis isomorphic  to M.
Given  a polytope  Pwe can construct  a polytope  ˆ2Psuch that the ﬂag graph  of ˆ2Pis the maniplex  ˆ2G(P). This con-
struction  is the following:
For −1 ≤i ≤n, denote  by Fithe set of i-faces  of P. If f∈ZFac(M)
2the support  of f, denoted  by supp(f), is deﬁned
as the set of facets  F∈Fac(M)such that f(F) =1. If we denote  by ˆFithe set of i-faces  of ˆ2P, then for −1 ≤i ≤nlet
ˆFi:=Fi×ZFac(M)
2/ ∼where  (F, x) ∼(F/prime, x/prime)if and only if F=F/primeand for every facet G ∈supp(x +x/prime)we have that F≤G.
We then add a formal  greatest  face Fn+1. Finally,  the incidence  relation  on ˆ2Pis given by (A, x) <(B, y)if and only if
A <Band (A, x) ∼(A, y).
We should  remark  that the construction  ˆ2Pis actually  (2P∗)∗, where  the superscript  ∗denotes  duality  and 2Pis a
better-known  construction  (see [3]).
In [5]i t is mentioned  that the operation  ˆ2Mwhere  Mis a maniplex  generalizes  ˆ2Pwhere  Pis a polytope.  What the
authors  mean by this is that if Pis a polytope,  then G(ˆ2P)is isomorphic  to ˆ2G(P)(see [11, Section 5.1] for  an elementary
proof).
The automorphisms  of Mhave a natural  action  on ˆ2M. First we deﬁne  a left action  of /Gamma1(M)on ZFac(M)
2as follows:
given an automorphism  σof M, a vector  xin ZFac(M)
2and a facet Fof Mwe deﬁne  that σx :f/mapsto→x(fσ). Now, if σ
is an automorphism  of M, we can extend  it to an automorphism  of ˆ2Mby deﬁning  (/Phi1, x)σ:=(/Phi1σ, σ−1x). Note that
supp(σ−1x) =supp(x)σ, so we are actually  using the natural  action  of an automorphism  on a set of facets.

Fig. 1.The set S3consisting  of the shaded  2-faces  is not invariant  under any non-trivial  symmetry  of M3and it is not contained  in the closure  of two
0-faces.
In [5, Section  6] it is proved  that the action  described  in the previous  paragraph  on ˆ2Mis by automorphisms.  Moreover,
the automorphism  group  of ˆ2Mis a product  of /Gamma1(M)and the group  T={Ty:(/Phi1, x) /mapsto→(/Phi1, x +y) :y ∈ZFac(M)
2}. This
implies  that if an n-maniplex  Mhas symmetry-type  graph  Xthen the symmetry-type  graph  of ˆ2Mis obtained  by adding
semiedges  of color nto each vertex  of X. In particular,  if Mis regular,  then ˆ2Mis regular  as well.
When  we let M2be the ﬂag graph  of a square  and deﬁne  Mi+1:=ˆ2M ifor i ≥2, M3happens  to be the ﬂag graph  of
the map on the torus called  {4, 4}(4,0)which  can be thought  of as a 4 ×4c h e s s  board  in which  we identify  opposite  sides
(without  twisting).  The 3-faces  of every subsequent  Mnwill be of this type and we will make use of this in our proofs.
A latticeis a poset in which  every pair of elements  {A, B}has a lowest  upper  bound  A ∨B(called  the joinof Aand B)
and a greatest  lower  bound  A ∧B(called  the meetof Aand B). It is known  that if Pis a lattice  then ˆ2Pis also a lattice.
One can verify  that if Aand Bare faces of P, x, y ∈ZFac(P)
2and there is at least one facet of ˆ2Pcontaining  both (A, x)and
(B, y)then,
(A,x)∨(B,y)=(A∨B,x)∼(A∨B,y),
and
(A,x)∧(B,y)=(C,x)∼(C,y)
where  Cis the greatest  lower  bound  of the set supp(x +y) ∪{A, B}. For a full proof of a more general  result  see [17,
Theorem 5].
Corollary  4.1. For n ≥2, the poset associated  with Mnis a lattice.
In [16, Proposition 15, Lemma 17] it  is proved  that the family  {Mn}n≥3satisﬁes  both conditions  mentioned  at the
beginning  of this section.  To prove that it satisﬁes  the second  condition,  the authors  prove and use the following  lemma:
Lemma  4.2. [16, Lemma 16] If Mhas a set of facets Sw h i c h  is not invariant  under any non-trivial  automorphism,  then there is an
involutory  monodromy  ηof ˆ2Mthat maps all the ﬂags of any given facet to different  facets.
Such a set Sis constructed  for M3, and recursively  constructed  for Mn+1in terms  of one constructed  for Mn. The
construction  is as follows:
If S⊂Fac(M)is a set of facets  that is not invariant  under  any non-trivial  automorphism,  then ˆS:= {(Fn, χF)|F∈S} ∪
{(Fn, 0)}(here 0 denotes  the all-zero  vector  in ZFacM
2) is a set of facets  of ˆ2Mand it satisﬁes  the same condition.
In [16]t h e authors  only care that Sis not invariant  under  any non-trivial  automorphism,  however  we shall choose  an S
that satisﬁes  some extra conditions,  which  will prove useful  when dealing  with the polytopality  of the constructed  2-orbit
maniplexes.
From now on, we call the shaded  set in Fig.1S3, and we call Sn⊂Fac(Mn)the set constructed  recursively  as Sn:=ˆSn−1
for n ≥4. Note that S3is not invariant  under  non-trivial  automorphisms  of M3, and therefore  Snis not invariant  under
non-trivial  automorphisms  of Mn. In [16], the authors  actually  use the complement  of the set we have chosen  as S3. The
reason  why we have chosen  the complement  will be apparent  when we prove Lemma 4.4.
Deﬁnition  4.3. Given  a polytope  Pand a face f∈Plet us deﬁne  the closure  of f, denoted  by f, as the set of all the facets
of Pwhich  are incident  to f.

Given  a preordered2set (P, ≤), one can give it a topology  by deﬁning  that a subset  Cis closed  if and only if whenever
x ∈Cand x ≤ywe get that y ∈C. In fact every topology  on a ﬁnite set can be obtained  from a preorder  in this way (see,
for example, [ 19]). In such context,  the closure  of a set Sis just S={y ∈P:∃x ∈S, x ≤y}. If we remove  the least and
greatest  faces of a polytope  Pand equip it with this topology,  then what we are calling  the closure  of fis actually  just the
set of facets  contained  in the topological  closure  of {f}.
Lemma  4.4. Given any two proper  faces u, vo f Mnwith n ≥3, the set Snis not contained  in u∪v.
Proof.We proceed  by induction  on n. For n =3t h i s  is a simple  observation  obtained  from Fig.1. Note that the closure  of
a face is contained  in the closure  of any incident  face of smaller  rank, so we only need to prove the lemma  for 0-faces.
Suppose  the lemma  is true for Mn. Let u, vbe 0-faces  of Mn+1, so that u =(u/prime, x)and v =(v/prime, y)for some 0-faces  u/prime, v/prime
of Mnand x, y ∈ZFac(M n)
2. We will prove that u∪vdoes not contain  even Sn+1\{(Fn, 0)}, so we may assume  that both u
and vare each incident  to at least one element  of Sn+1other than (Fn, 0), say for example  that u =(u/prime, x) <(Fn, χG)for
some facet Gof Mn. By our deﬁnition  of the order <, this implies  that u/prime<Fn(which  is tautological)  and (u/prime, x) ∼(u/prime, χG),
so we may assume  without  loss of generality  that x =χG. Analogously  we may assume  that there exists  a facet Fin Mn
such that y =χF.
A facet (Fn, z)is in u∪vif and only if supp(z+χG) ⊂u/primeor supp(z+χF) ⊂v/prime. By induction  hypothesis,  Snis not
contained  in u/prime∪v/prime, so there exists  a facet D ∈Sn\(u/prime∪v/prime). Then (Fn, χD)is a facet in Sn+1not in u∪v./Box
In topological  terms,  Lemma 4.4tells us that no set of two elements  is densein Sn.
Now we turn our attention  to the monodromy  η. In the proof of Lemma 4.2found  in [16], ηis constructed  as follows:
Let Mbe a regular  maniplex  and let Sbe a set of facets  not invariant  under  non-trivial  automorphisms.  For every facet
F∈Slet /Phi1Fbe a ﬁxed base ﬂag in that facet. Let F0be a base facet in Sand let /Phi1 =/Phi1F0. For every F∈S, let ωFbe a
monodromy  of Mthat maps /Phi1to /Phi1F. Note that since Mis regular,  its monodromy  group  acts regularly  on its ﬂags, so
ωFis actually  unique.  Then for every ﬂag (/Psi1, x)in ˆ2Mdeﬁne  (/Psi1, x)η:=(/Psi1, x +/summationtext
F∈SχFac(/Psi1ωF)). The action  of ηwill be
more clear with the following  lemma.
Lemma  4.5. Let (/Psi1, x) ∈ˆ2M. Let γbe the automorphism  of Mmapping  the base ﬂag /Phi1of F0to /Psi1. Then, the vector  corresponding
to the facet of (/Psi1, x)ηdiffers  from xo n l y  in the coordinates  corresponding  to Sγ, that is, if (/Psi1, x)η=(/Psi1, y)then supp(x +y) =Sγ.
Proof.For every F∈Swe have that
/Psi1ωF=(/Phi1γ)ωF=(/Phi1ωF)γ,
so
Fac(/Psi1ωF)=Fac((/Phi1ωF)γ)=(Fac(/Phi1ωF))γ=(Fac(/Phi1F))γ=Fγ.
This implies  that (/Psi1, x)η=(/Psi1, x +/summationtext
F∈SχFac(/Psi1ωF)) =(/Psi1, x +/summationtext
F∈SχFγ)so y =x +/summationtext
F∈SχFγ. By doing  the change  of
variable  G =Fγwe get y =x +/summationtext
G∈SγχGand supp(x +y) =Sγ./Box
Given  two sets Sand S/primeof facets  of a polytope  P, we say that S/primeis a copy of Sif there is an automorphism  γof Psuch
that S/prime=Sγ. Lemma 4.5tells us that if (/Psi1, x)η=(/Psi1, y)then supp(x +y)is a copy of S.
In [16, Lemma 16] it  is proved  that ηis in fact a monodromy  of ˆ2Mand that if Sis not invariant  under  non-trivial
automorphisms  of Mthen ηmaps all the ﬂags of a facet of ˆ2Mto different  facets.
Note that using a set of facets  of Mnnot invariant  under  non-trivial  automorphisms  we constructed  the monodromy  η
for Mn+1. We have found  such sets of facets  for Mnwith n ≥3, which  means  that we have found  the monodromy  ηfor
n ≥4. We have not found  the monodromy  ηfor M3, since every set of facets  (edges)  of M2(the square)  is invariant  under
some non-trivial  automorphism.  Actually  M3does not have such a monodromy.
However,  the map on the torus {4, 4}(8,0)(a chess board  of regular  size where  each border  is identiﬁed  with its opposite)
does admit  such a monodromy:  simply  take η=r2r1r0r1r2r1r2r1. This monodromy  is indeed  involutory  (use the fact that
r1r2has order 4) and it maps the 8 ﬂags of a facet to the 8 squares  where  a knight  could legally  move in a game of chess.
This example  also covers  all 2-vertex  premaniplexes  in rank 3, so, to construct  2-orbit  polytopes  of rank 4, one may use this
example  instead  of M3.

5. 2-orbit  maniplexes
The symmetry  type of a 2-orbit  maniplex  is denoted  by 2n
Iwhere  ndenotes  the rank and Iis a proper  subset  of
{0, 1, ..., n −1}. Some authors  assume  the rank is implicit  and just write 2I, but we shall not do that in this paper  as we
will be working  with several  different  ranks at once. In this notation,  Iis the set of colors  isuch that any ﬂag is in the
same orbit as its i-adjacent  ﬂag. In terms  of the symmetry-type  graph,  Iis the set of colors  of the semiedges.  Informally,
we may think of Ias the set of “allowed  kinds of reﬂections”.  In particular,  chiral n-polytopes  are those of type 2n
∅, that is,
those in which  no reﬂections  are allowed.
In order to ﬁnd 2-orbit  polytopes  (resp. maniplexes)  with every possible  2-vertex  premaniplex  as its symmetry-type
graph,  we only need to ﬁnd examples  with all the symmetry  types 2n
Iwhere  0, n −1 ∈I, and then use the operations  ˆ2M
and duality  (see [16, Corollary 12] for  details).  So without  loss of generality,  we will assume  that 0, n −1 ∈I.
Given  a 2-vertex  premaniplex  X=2n+1
Iwith 0, n ∈I, the authors  of [16]g i v e a voltage  assignment  to its darts such that
the derived  graph  is a 2-orbit  maniplex  with symmetry-type  graph  isomorphic  to X. We discuss  this voltage  assignment
next.
Let us color the vertices  of Xone white  and one black.  Let {r0, r1, ..., rn−1}be the distinguished  generators  of the
monodromy  group  of Mn. If dis a semiedge  incident  on the white  vertex  we assign  to it the voltage  riwhere  iis its color.
If dis a semiedge  of color iincident  to the black vertex,  we assign  to it the voltage  r0rir0, or in other words,  riif i >1a n d
r0r1r0if i =1. Finally,  if dis a dart of color i <nfrom the white  vertex  to the black vertex  we assign  to it the voltage  r0ri,
in particular,  the voltage  of the edge of color 0 is trivial.  We shall give the voltage  of the edge of color nshortly  (which  will
be an involution,  so orientation  is irrelevant).  From now on, we call this voltage  assignment  ξ.
Let p :Mn→Xnbe a covering  (remember  that Xnis the result  of removing  the edge of color nfrom X). We color the
ﬂags of Mnwhite  or black according  to the color of their image  under  p. Since Xnhas exactly  2 vertices  and Mncovers
X, then every monodromy  of Mneither  preserves  the color of every ﬂag or it changes  the color of every ﬂag. Note that
the voltages  of every dart preserve  the color of the ﬂags when thought  of as monodromies.
5.1. The voltage  of the darts of color n
Now we turn our attention  to the voltage  of the darts of color n. In [16]t h e authors  make the voltage  group  act on
(Mn)w×Z2/lscriptfor some large /lscript, where  (Mn)wis the set of white  ﬂags of Mn(recall  that all voltages  preserve  the color
of the ﬂags).  This action  is simply  deﬁned  by (/Psi1, x)ω=(/Psi1ω, x)for all (/Psi1, x) ∈(Mn)w×Z2/lscriptand every monodromy  ω.
In other words,  each monodromy  acts as usual in the (Mn)w-coordinate  and as the identity  on the Z2/lscript-coordinate.  The
voltage  /tildewideynof the darts of color nis deﬁned  as the composition  of three commuting  involutions  /tildewideρ0, r0and s. Both r0and
/tildewideρ0act only on the (Mn)wcoordinate  and are independent  of the Z2/lscriptone, while sacts only on the Z2/lscriptcoordinate.  To
avoid future  confusion,  the reader  must recall that F(Mn) =F(Mn−1) ×ZFac(M n−1)
2, so F(Mn) ×Z2/lscriptmay be regarded
as F(Mn−1) ×ZFac(M n−1)
2×Z2/lscript. The importance  of the Z2/lscriptcoordinate  lies in that it is used to prove that the derived
maniplex  is in fact a 2-orbit  maniplex  (and not a regular  one), but it has no relevance  when proving  that the derived
graph  is a maniplex.  For our purposes,  we will ignore  sfor now. Therefore,  we may think of all actions  as being on
F(Mn) =F(Mn−1) ×ZFac(M n−1)
2, and assign  the voltage  yn:=/tildewideρ0r0to the edge of color n.
In order to deﬁne  /tildewideρ0we ﬁrst need to choose  a base ﬂag/Phi1Ffor each facet Fof Mn. For the proof in [16]t o work, we
ﬁrst choose  a base facet F 0=(fn−1, 0)of Mn(where  fn−1is the greatest  face of Mn−1) and then for every whiteﬂag /Psi1
in F0we set /Psi1r0ηr0to be the base ﬂag of its facet. Recall  that ηmaps all the ﬂags of F0to different  facets,  so there is
no ambiguity.  In [16]a l l the other base ﬂags are chosen  arbitrarily,  however  we will later have a preferred  choice  for them
too. Then we deﬁne  /tildewideρ0as the ﬂag permutation  that acts on each facet Fas the reﬂection  (facet automorphism)  that ﬁxes
all the faces of the base ﬂag /Phi1Fbut its 0-face.
Note that if we replace  a base ﬂag with any ﬂag sharing  the same edge (1-face)  and the same facet, we get the same
permutation  /tildewideρ0. So we may deﬁne  a base edgeof a facet Fas the 1-face  of the corresponding  base ﬂag and forget  about  the
base ﬂag.
Now the previous  choice  of base edges  would  be equivalent  to the following:  For every blackﬂag /Psi1in F0we set (/Psi1η)1
(the edge of /Psi1η) to be the base edge of its facet.
Let /Psi1be a black ﬂag in F0. Since Mn=ˆ2M n−1, and by the choice  of F0, the ﬂag /Psi1can be written  as (ψ, 0)for some
ﬂag ψin Mn−1. Lemma 4.5tells us that /Psi1η=(ψ, x)for some x ∈ZFac(M n−1)
2satisfying  that supp(x)is a copy of Sn−1.
So for facets  corresponding  to vectors  whose  support  is a copy of Sn−1we are forced  to choose  a speciﬁc  base edge, but
for any other facet we may choose  the base edge as we want. Let (e, 0)be the base edge of the base facet F0=(fn−1, 0).
8
E. Mochán Discrete Mathematics 347 (2024) 114055
Then for every xwhose  support  is not a copy of Sn−1we choose  (e, x)as the base edge of the facet (fn−1, x). We summarize
this in the following  deﬁnition:
Deﬁnition  5.1. Base edges:Let (e, 0)be the base edge of the base facet of Mn, let x ∈ZFac(M n)
2and let fn−1be the greatest
face of Mn−1. If supp(x)is not a copy of Sn−1, then we deﬁne  the base edge of the facet (fn−1, x)of Mnto be (e, x). If
supp(x) =Sn−1γfor some γ∈/Gamma1(Mn−1), then we deﬁne  the base edge of (fn−1, x)to be (eγ, x).
Corollary  5.2. If x ∈ZFac(M n)
2is such that supp(x) ⊂u∪vf o r some faces u, vi n Mn−1, then the base edge of the facet (fn−1, x)is
(e, x).
Corollary  5.3. If (e, 0)is the base edge of the base facet (fn−1, 0)of Mn, then it is also the base edge of any other facet containing  it.
Proof.If (fn−1, x)is a facet containing  (e, 0)then supp(x) ⊂e. Then, Corollary 5.2tells us that base edge of (fn−1, x)is
(e, x) ∼(e, 0)./Box
Finally  we let yn:=/tildewideρ0r0and extend  the voltage  assignment  ξby assigning  ynas the voltage  of the edge of color nof
X. Note that since /tildewideρ0acts as an automorphism  in each facet, it commutes  with all the monodromies  that do not use the
generator  rn. In particular  /tildewideρ0commutes  with r0, implying  that ynis an involution.
As previously  discussed,  in [16]t h e authors  consider  the voltage  group  as acting  on (Mn)w×Z2/lscriptwhere  (Mn)wis the
set of white  ﬂags of Mnand /lscriptis some large integer.  If (/Psi1, a) ∈(Mn)w×Z2/lscriptand ωis a color preserving  monodromy  of
Mnthen (/Psi1, a)ωis simply  deﬁned  as (/Psi1ω, a). Then they use /tildewideyn:=/tildewideρ0r0sas the voltage  of the edge of color n, where  sis
an involution  acting  only on the Z2/lscriptcoordinate.  We will call the voltage  assignment  used in [16]ξ/prime. In [16]t h e authors
prove that Xξ/primeis a maniplex  with symmetry-type  graph  isomorphic  to X. The proof of the fact that Xξ/primeis a maniplex  also
applies  to Xξ, but the proof of the fact Xξ/primeis not regular  relies heavily  on /lscriptbeing large. On the other hand Xξis either
regular  or has symmetry-type  graph  isomorphic  to X. However  our proofs  to show polytopality  of some derived  maniplexes
will be much clearer  if we work with the voltage  assignment  ξand consider  that ξ=πM nξ/primewhere  πM nis the projection
to the Mn-coordinate.  That is, the ξ-voltage  of a path is just the ﬁrst coordinate  of the ξ/prime-voltage  of the same path. More
formally,  we deﬁne:

Note that two paths may have the same ξ-voltage  while having  different  ξ/prime-voltages,  but not the other way around.
6. Polytopality
In this section  we prove that if I=[1, n −1] ={1, 2, ..., n −1}, then the derived  graph  from the voltage  graph  X=2n+1
I
in Fig.2is polytopal.  We will ﬁrst prove that most of the intersection  properties  are satisﬁed  for arbitrary  I, implying  that
there are only a few intersection  properties  that would  be needed  to check  to prove that there are 2-orbit  polytopes  of
all symmetry-types  in rank n ≥3. Once we have done this, we will prove that the remaining  intersection  properties  are
satisﬁed  for I=[1, n −1](see Fig.3).
In order to deal with the intersection  properties  in Theorem 3.2for this particular  voltage  assignment,  we should  ﬁrst
understand  better  what are the voltages  of paths in the voltage  graph  in Fig.2with respect  to the colors  they use. To do
this we prove Lemmas 6.2and6.3, which  describe  the voltages  of some of the paths relevant  to our results.
Let us ﬁrst prove the following:
9
E. Mochán Discrete Mathematics 347 (2024) 114055
Claim  6.1. Let n ≥3. Let W=d1d2···dmbe a path in the voltage  graph  of Fig.2. Let cibe the color of the dart di. If
ci/∈{1, n}for all i ∈{1, 2, ..., m}then ξ(W) =rε
0rcmrcm−1···rc1where  εis 0 or 1 depending  on whether  the path Wis
closed  or open, respectively.
Proof.Note that Wis closed  if it uses an even number  of links, and it is open if it uses an odd number  of links.
If dmis a semiedge  based  on the white  vertex,  then
ξ(d1d2···dm)=rcmξ(d1d1···dm−1).
If dmis a dart from the white  vertex  to the black one, then
ξ(d1d2···dm)=r0rcmξ(d1d1···dm−1).
If dmis a dart from the black vertex  to the white  one, then, since cm/negationslash=n,
ξ(d1d2···dm)=rcmr0ξ(d1d1···dm−1)
but since cm/negationslash=1w e know that rcmr0=r0rcmand we get
ξ(d1d2···dm)=r0rcmξ(d1d1···dm−1).
And if dmis a semiedge  on the black vertex  then
ξ(d1d2···dm)=r0rcmr0ξ(d1d1···dm−1)
but since cm/negationslash=1t h i s  means  ξ(d1d2···dm) =rcmξ(d1d1···dm−1). If we repeat  this argument  for dm−1, then dm−2and so on,
and note that since ci/negationslash=1t h e n  rcicommutes  with r0for all i, we get the desired  result. /Box
If /Phi1is a ﬂag and K⊂{0, 1, ..., n −1}, we will denote  by (/Phi1)Kthe set of faces in /Phi1whose  rank is in K. The following
lemma  characterizes  the voltages  of closedpaths that do not use edges  of color 1o r the edge of color nand voltage  yn.
Lemma  6.2. Let ωbe a monodromy  of Mnthat preserves  the color of its ﬂags and K⊂{0, 1, ..., n −1}. Suppose  1 ∈K. Then for
every white ﬂag /Phi1of Mnwe have that (/Phi1)K=(/Phi1ω)Kif and only if ωis the voltage  of aclosed  path based on the white vertex  of X
that does not use colors in K∪{n}.
Proof. (/Phi1)K=(/Phi1ω)K, by strong  connectedness  of Mnthere is a path /tildewiderWfrom /Phi1to /Phi1ωnot using colors  in K. Let c1c2···ck
be the sequence  of colors  of /tildewiderW. Then /Phi1ω=/Phi1rc1rc2···rck, but since Mnis regular,  the action  of the monodromy  group  on
the ﬂags is regular,  so we conclude  that ω=rc1rc2···rck.
Let Wbe the path on Xthat starts on the white  vertex  and follows  the sequence  of colors  c1c2···ck, that is W=p(/tildewiderW).
We know that /Phi1ωand /Phi1are both white,  so Wmust be a closed  path. Recall  that the voltage  of Wis the product  of the
voltages  of its darts but in reverse  order.  Let a1a2···akbe the dart sequence  of W. Let us consider  W−1=akak−1···a1.
Since Wdoes not use colors  in Kand 1 ∈K, Claim6.1tells us that ξ(W−1) =rε
0ωand since Wis closed,  W−1is closed
too, so ε=0 and  ξ(W−1) =ω. Thus we have found  a closed  path that does not use colors  in K∪{n}and has voltage  ω.
For the converse,  let W=a1a2···akbe a closed  path based  on the white  vertex  of Xand suppose  that Wdoes not
use colors  in K∪{n}. Since Wdoes not use the color 1 (because  1 ∈K), Claim6.1tells us that ω:=ξ(W) =rckrck−1···rc1
where  ciis the color of ai. Since ci/∈K∪{n}we know that (/Phi1ω)K=(/Phi1)K./Box
Using  the same logic one can prove the following  lemma,  which  characterizes  the voltages  of openpaths that do not use
edges  of color 1o r the edge of color nand voltage  yn.
Lemma  6.3. Let ωbe a monodromy  of Mnthat preserves  the color of the ﬂags and K⊂{0, 1, ..., n −1}. Then (/Phi1)K=(/Phi10ω)Kif
and only if ωis the voltage  of anopen path in Xthat does not use colors in K∪{n}.
We want to show that if Xis the 2-vertex  premaniplex  with links of colors  0 and nand semiedges  of the colors  in-
between  (see Fig.3), and ξis the voltage  assignment  deﬁned  in (2), then the condition  of Theorem 3.2is satisﬁed,  that is,
we want to prove that if X=ˆ2n+1
[1,n−1], we have that
ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m](X))∩ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n](X))=ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,m](X)),
for all k, m ∈[0, n]and all pairs of vertices  (a, b).
In [16]t h e authors  only use the sets Snto ﬁnd the monodromy  ηof Mnmapping  all the ﬂags of a given facet to
different  facets.  To ensure  that ηacts this way they only need to use the fact that Snis not invariant  under  non-trivial

automorphisms,  and they do not consider  any other properties.  However,  for our purposes  this condition  is not enough.  We
also need ηto map the ﬂags of the base facet “very far away”.  This is to ensure  that “close  facets”  have the same base edge
as the base facet. This is why we have proved  Corollary 5.2.
First we will prove that the intersection  condition  is satisﬁed  for k >1f o r every 2-vertex  premaniplex  2n+1
Iwhere
0, n ∈I.
Theorem  6.4. Let Xbe an (n +1)-premaniplex  with two vertices  and with links of color 0 and n, that is X=2n+1
Iwith 0, n ∈I. Let
ξbe the voltage  assignment  deﬁned  in (2). Then, for k >1and for all m ∈[0, n]we have that
ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m](X))∩ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n](X))=ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,m](X)),
for all pairs of vertices  (a, b)in X.
Before  proceeding  with the proof,  let us introduce  a few new concepts.  Let Mbe a maniplex  of rank nand let μbe a
ﬂag permutation  of M. Let i ∈{0, 1, ..., n −1}and let Fand Gbe i-faces  of M. If μmaps every ﬂag with i-face Fto a
ﬂag with i-face Gwe will say that μmaps Ft o G. In the case where  F=Gwe will say that μﬁxes F. If μﬁxes Ffor every
i-face Fwe will say that μﬁxes i-faces.
To simplify  notation,  in what follows  we will write /Pi1a,b
Iinstead  of /Pi1a,b
I(X), taking  for granted  that we are speaking
about  paths on X. Recall  that the interval  [k, m]is considered  to be the empty  set when k >mand that ξ(/Pi1a,b
∅)is the
trivial  group  if a =band it is the empty  set if a /negationslash=b.
Proof.If m =nthere is nothing  to prove.  If m <nthen ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m])is generated  by monodromies  of Mnmapping  any white
ﬂag /Phi1in Mnto a white  ﬂag with the same i-faces  for i >m.
Now let W∈/Pi1a,b
[k,n]be such that ξ(W) ∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m]). Observe  that ξ(W)must be a monodromy  of Mnthat preserves  i-
faces for i >m. Let /Phi1be the base ﬂag of the base facet of Mn. Note that, since k >1, the elements  of ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n])are products
of ﬂag permutations  that do not change  the 1-face  of /Phi1, that is, for every ω∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n])we have that (/Phi1ω)1=(/Phi1)1. This
implies  that /Phi1ωyn=/Phi1ω, as all facets  containing  (/Phi1)1must have it as their base edge because  of Corollary 5.3. Note also
that if 1 <i <n, then the voltage  of all darts of color iis the same.  This means  that, if we write ξ(W) ∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n])as the
product  of the voltages  of the darts of W, it acts on /Phi1the same way as the voltage  of the path W/primethat follows  the same
colors  as Wbut ignoring  each occurrence  of a dart of color n.
If Wuses an even number  of darts of color n, then W/primehas the same endpoints  as Wand its voltage  ξ(W/prime)acts in the
same way as κ=ξ(W)on /Phi1. Since Mnis regular,  if κis a monodromy  of Mnit must coincide  with ξ(W/prime), since it is also
a monodromy  acting  the same way on some ﬂag. But W/prime∈/Pi1a,b
[k,n−1], so then we have that κ∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m]) ∩ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n−1]). Since
κ∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n−1]), it must be a monodromy  that preserves  i-faces  for i <k, and since κ∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m]), it also preserves  i-faces
for i >m. Then, by Lemmas 6.2and6.3, κ∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,m]).
Now we want to prove that if ξ(W) ∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m])then Wcannot  use an odd number  of darts of color n, thus proving  that
ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m]) ∩ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n]) =ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,m]).
Let (e, 0)be the 1-face  of /Phi1, (e0, 0)be the 1-face  of /Phi11and (e1, 0)be the 1-face  of /Phi1010. Here we are thinking  of e, e0
and e1as 1-faces  of the polytope  Mn−1, which  is naturally  isomorphic  to any facet of Mn(see Fig.4).
If F=(fn−1, x)is a facet of Mnwhich  has (e, x)as its base edge, then yninterchanges  ﬂags with 1-face  (e0, x)with
ﬂags with 1-face  (e1, x), while it ﬁxes ﬂags with 1-face  (e, x)(see Fig.5).
Let ω∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n−1]), let Fbe a facet with base edge (e, x), and let /Psi1be a ﬂag with facet Fand 1-face  (ej, x)for j ∈{0, 1}.
Let (ψ, y) =/Psi1ω. If we write ωas a product  of the voltages  of darts, every time we change  the facet of Mn(that is, every
occurrence  of rn−1or r0rn−1), we must change  to a new facet with the same edge. This means  that the edge of /Psi1ωmust
be the same as the edge of /Psi1, or in other words,  that (ej, y) ∼(ej, x)where  ∼is the equivalence  relation  we used when
deﬁning  ˆ2Pfor a polytope  P. Then supp(x +y)is contained  in ej.
Now let κ∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n])and consider  /Phi11κand /Phi110κ. Since 0 /∈I, then {/Phi11κ, /Phi110κ}has exactly  one white  ﬂag and one
black ﬂag. Set (ψ, x)to be the white  ﬂag in {/Phi11κ, /Phi110κ}. Using  again the fact that the voltage  of a dart with color greater
than 1 does not depend  on its startpoint,  we may write κas ω1ynω2yn···ωs−1ynωswhere  ωi∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n−1]). Each ωi

may change  the facet to one where  the support  of the corresponding  vector  differs  in coordinates  corresponding  to a set
contained  in e0∪e1. Let
(ψi,xi)=/braceleftBigg
/Phi11ω1ynω2yn···ωiIf(ψ,x)=/Phi11κ,
/Phi110ω1ynω2yn···ωiIf(ψ,x)=/Phi110κ.
We claim that supp(xi) ⊂e0∪e1. This is proved  by a simple  induction  on i. For i =1w e have that x1=0, which  has
support  supp(0) =∅ ⊂e0∪e1. If the claim is true for i, since supp(xi) ⊂e0∪e1, Corollary 5.2tells us that the facet of Mn
corresponding  to xihas (e, xi)as its base edge. Hence,  if (ψi, xi)has (ej, xi)as its 1-face,  then (ψi+1, xi+1) =(ψi, xi)ynωi+1
has e1−jas its 1-face.  This implies  that supp(xi+xi+1) ⊂e0∪e1. Then
supp(xi+1)=supp((xi+xi+1)+xi)⊂supp(xi+xi+1)∪supp(xi)⊂e0∪e1.
Thus we have proved  our claim.  Note that x =xs, so our claim and Corollary 5.2tell us that the facet (fn−1, x)of Mn
(where  fn−1is the greatest  face of Mn−1) has base edge (e, x).
Since we assumed  that Wuses an odd number  of darts of color n, we know by our claim that its voltage  κ=ξ(W)
maps /Phi11or /Phi110, with edge (e0, 0), to a ﬂag with edge (e1, x)(for some x). But we know also that it maps /Phi1to a ﬂag with
the same edge (e, 0). Since Mnis regular,  κcannot  be a monodromy  of Mn(if a monodromy  of a regular  polytope  ﬁxes
one edge, it must ﬁx all edges),  so it cannot  be in ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m])./Box
Corollary  6.5. Let Xbe an (n +1)-premaniplex  with two vertices  and with links of color 0 and n, that is X=2n+1
Iwith 0, n ∈I. Let
ξ/primebe the voltage  assignment  deﬁned  in (3). Then, for k >1and for all m ∈[0, n]we have that
ξ/prime(/Pi1a,b
[0,m])∩ξ/prime(/Pi1a,b
[k,n])=ξ/prime(/Pi1a,b
[k,m]),
for all pairs of vertices  (a, b)in X.
Proof.Since for m =nthere is nothing  to prove,  let us assume  that m <n. Let /tildewideω∈ξ/prime(/Pi1a,b
[0,m]) ∩ξ/prime(/Pi1a,b
[k,n]). Let πM nω=/tildewideω,
that is, ωis the same function  as /tildewideωbut considering  only its action  on the (Mn)w-coordinate.  By Theorem 6.4ω∈ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,m]).
We also know that since m <nand /tildewideω∈ξ/prime(/Pi1a,b
[0,m])then /tildewideωis a monodromy  of Mnand does not change  the Z2/lscript-coordinate
of the elements  of (Mn)w×Z2/lscript. Let W∈/Pi1a,b
[k,m]be a path such that ξ(W) =ω. Then πM n(ξ/prime(W)) =ξ(W) =ω=πM n/tildewideω,
but also πZ2/lscript(ξ/prime(W)) =IdZ2/lscript=πZ2/lscript/tildewideω. Therefore  ξ/prime(W) =/tildewideω∈ξ/prime(/Pi1a,b
[k,m])./Box

Fig. 6.The premaniplex (2n+1
[1,n−1])0with its voltage assignment.
Now we want to prove that we can remove  the restriction  k >1f r o m  Theorem 6.4when I=[1, n −1]. First we need
the following  lemmas:
Lemma  6.6. Let ab e the white vertex  on the premaniplex  2n
[1,n−1](Fig. 3). Then, the group ξ(/Pi1a
[1,n])is generated  by {ri}n−1
i=1∪
{/tildewideρ0rn−1/tildewideρ0}.
Proof.When  we remove  the link of color 0, we are left with a unique  spanning  tree: the one consisting  only of the link
of color nand voltage  yn=r0/tildewideρ0(see Fig.6). Then, the generator  corresponding  to a semiedge  of color i ∈[1, n −1]on the
white  vertex  is its voltage  ri. The generator  corresponding  to a semiedge  eon the black vertex  is the voltage  of the path
anea−1
n, where  anis the dart from the white  vertex  to the black one with color n. This voltage  is
ξ(anea−1
n)=ξ(an)−1ξ(e)ξ(an)=(yn)(r0rir0)(yn)=/tildewideρ0ri/tildewideρ0.
So ξ(/Pi1a
[1,n]) =/angbracketleft {ri}n−1
i=1∪{/tildewideρ0ri/tildewideρ0}n−1
i=1/angbracketright. But since /tildewideρ0acts as an automorphism  in each facet, for i <n −1w e get /tildewideρ0ri/tildewideρ0=ri,
and we get ξ(/Pi1a
[1,n]) =/angbracketleft {ri}n−1
i=1∪{/tildewideρ0rn−1/tildewideρ0}/angbracketright./Box
Lemma  6.7. Let (e, 0)be the base edge of the base facet of Mn, and let ua n d vb e the vertices  of Mn−1incident  to e. If x ∈ZFac(M n−1)
2
is such that supp(x) ⊂u∪va n d ψis a ﬂag in Mn−1with vertex  u, then (ψ, x)/tildewideρ0rn−1/tildewideρ0=(ψ, y)for a vector  y satisfying  supp(y) ⊂
u∪v.
Moreover,  if ω∈ξ(/Pi1a
[1,n])and (ψ, x)ω=(ψ/prime, y)then ψ/prime
0=ua n d supp(y) ⊂u∪v.
Proof.We know by Corollary 5.2that the facet (fn−1, x)of Mnhas base edge (e, x). Let /Psi1 =(ψ, x). The vertex  of /Psi1is (u, x).
Let (ψ/prime, x) :=/Psi1/tildewideρ0. We must have that (ψ/prime)0=v. Then /Psi1/tildewideρ0rn−1=(ψ/prime, x +χF)for some F∈v. Since supp(x +χF) ⊂u∪v
we know that the facet (fn−1, x +χF)has base edge (e, x +χF). This implies  that /Psi1/tildewideρ0rn−1/tildewideρ0=(ψ/prime, x +χF)/tildewideρ0=(ψ, x +χF).
To complete  the proof use Lemma 6.6and note that each riﬁxes the vertex  of any ﬂag./Box
Theorem  6.8. If X=2n+1
[1,n−1], then Xis the symmetry-type  graph of a polytope.
Proof.We will prove that the voltage  assignment  ξdeﬁned  in (2)s a t i s ﬁ e s  that
ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m])∩ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,n])=ξ(/Pi1a,b
[k,m]) (4)
for all k, m ∈[0, n]and all pairs of vertices  (a, b). This will imply  that ξ/prime(deﬁned  in (3)) also satisﬁes  this intersection
property  (exactly  as in the proof of Corollary 6.5). Then, Theorem 3.2will imply  that both Xξand Xξ/primeare polytopal,  and
since we already  know that Xξ/primehas symmetry-type  graph  Xthe theorem  follows.  Since Theorem 6.4tells us that (4)h o l d s
for k >1 and  it trivially  holds for k =0, we only need to prove the case when k =1.
Let us ﬁrst prove the case for closed  paths,  that is, we will prove that
ξ(/Pi1a
[1,n])∩ξ(/Pi1a
[0,m])=ξ(/Pi1a
[1,m]).
Once again,  for m =nthere is nothing  to prove,  so let m <n.
We prove ﬁrst the case when m <n −1. Let ω∈ξ(/Pi1a
[1,n]) ∩ξ(/Pi1a
[0,m]). Since ω∈ξ(/Pi1a
[0,m]) =/angbracketleftri|i ≤m/angbracketright, it must be a
monodromy  of Mnand since m <n −1, it must ﬁx facets.  Let /Phi1 =(φ, 0)be the base ﬂag of the base facet of Mnand
let e =(φ)1, u =(φ)0and v =(φ0)0(see Fig.7). Lemma 6.7implies  that /Phi1ω=(ψ, x)for some ﬂag ψin Mn−1and some
vector  x ∈ZFac(M n−1)
2satisfying  (ψ)0=uand supp(x) ⊂u∪v. But since ωmust ﬁx facets,  xis actually  0. This means
that (/Phi1ω)0=(/Phi1)0, and since Mnis regular,  this means  that ωﬁxes all 0-faces.  Also because  of the regularity  of Mn, the
monodromies  in ξ(/Pi1a
[0,m]) =/angbracketleftri|i ≤m/angbracketrightthat ﬁx 0-faces  are /angbracketleftri|1 ≤i ≤m/angbracketright, but this is precisely  ξ(/Pi1a
[1,m]).
Now, if m =n −1w e have a little more work to do. We proceed  as in the previous  case, but we cannot  ensure  that
x =0. However,  we have that /Phi1ω=(ψ, x)and the inclusion  supp(x) ⊂u∪vstill holds.  By writing  the 2-face  of /Phi1as
(/Phi1)2=(Q, 0), we know that Qis a square.  Let wbe the opposite  vertex  of uin Qand qbe the opposite  vertex  to v, so
that the vertices  of Qare uvwqin cyclical  order (see Fig.7).
13

Fig. 7.The 2-face Qand its vertices u,v,wand q.
Since ωis a monodromy  of Mn, it must commute  with the automorphism  ρ1of Mn, which  maps /Phi1to /Phi11. This implies
that
/Phi11ω=(/Phi1ω)ρ1=(ψ,x)ρ1=(ψρ1,ρ1x).
Here we have used the way /Gamma1(Mn−1)acts on Mndiscussed  on Section 4. Note that we have used the same symbol  ρ1to
denote  an automorphism  of Mnand also an automorphism  of Mn−1, but because  of the way /Gamma1(Mn−1)acts on Mnthis is
actually  not ambiguous.
Notice  that supp(ρ1x) =(supp(x))ρ1must be contained  in (u∪v)ρ1=u∪q. On the other hand, the vector  corresponding
to /Phi11is 0, so Lemma 6.7tells us that supp(ρ1x) ⊂u∪v. Every facet incident  to both vand qmust be incident  to
Q=v ∨q(see Corollary 4.1), and hence  also to u. Then, the intersection  (u∪q) ∩(u∪v)is just uwhich  means  that ω
ﬁxes the vertex  of /Phi11, and therefore  it must ﬁx the vertex  of every ﬂag (again,  Mnis regular).  Hence,  we conclude  that
ξ(/Pi1a
[1,n]) ∩ξ(/Pi1a
[0,m]) =ξ(/Pi1a
[1,m]).
Now let us solve the case for open paths,  that is, let us prove that ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m]) ∩ξ(/Pi1a,b
[1,n]) =ξ(/Pi1a,b
[1,m])when ais the white
vertex  and bthe black vertex.
First notice  that since we only have links of colors  0 and n, we know that ξ(/Pi1a,b
[1,m])is in fact empty.  So what we really
want to prove is that there are no monodromies  in ξ(/Pi1a,b
[1,n]).
Notice  that /Pi1a,b
[1,n]=/Pi1a
[1,n]an, where  once again,  anis the dart of color nfrom ato b. Then
ξ(/Pi1a,b
[1,n])=ξ(/Pi1a
[1,n]an)=ynξ(/Pi1a
[1,n]).
Let ω∈ξ(/Pi1a
[1,n]). We want to prove that ynωis not a monodromy  of Mn. If it was, it would  also act as a monodromy
on Mn−1(just ignore  the ZFac(M n−1)
2-coordinate).  Take the base ﬂag φof Mn−1. Then φynω=φω, and Lemma 6.7tells
us that this must be a ﬂag with vertex  u(the same vertex  as φ). Now, if we consider  φ1(with vertex  u) we get that
φ1ynω=φ1/tildewideρ0r0ω=φ010ωis a ﬂag with vertex  w. Then ynωcannot  act as a monodromy  on Mn−1, since it ﬁxes the
vertex  of some ﬂags but it changes  the vertex  of others  and Mn−1is regular.  Therefore,  ynωis not a monodromy  of Mn.
We have proved  that ξ(/Pi1a,b
[0,m]) ∩ξ(/Pi1a,b
[1,n]) =∅.
Thus we have proved  that (4) holds.  By doing  a proof analogous  to that of Corollary 6.5we get that ξ/prime(/Pi1a,b
[0,m]) ∩
ξ/prime(/Pi1a,b
[k,n]) =ξ/prime(/Pi1a,b
[k,m])for all k, m ∈[0, n]. Theorem 3.2then implies  that Xξ/primeis polytopal.  Since we already  knew that
T(Xξ/prime) ∼=X, we have found  a polytope  whose  symmetry-type  graph  is isomorphic  to X./Box
Recall  once again that examples  of polyhedra  (rank 3) of all possible  2-orbit  symmetry  types exist, in particular  those
with 1 or 2 links. Applying  the constructions  2Por ˆ2Prepeatedly  to the examples  of 2 links of Theorem 6.8or the
examples  of rank 3 one gets that all symmetry  types with 1 or 2 links exist in any rank higher  than two. In addition  to
this, as previously  discussed,  in [14] Pellicer  proves  that chiral polytopes  (those  with symmetry  type 2n
∅) exist in rank 3 and
higher,  and if we apply the constructions  2Por ˆ2Pto those,  we get all symmetry  types where  all the links have consecutive
colors.  In conclusion,  we have the following  theorem:
Theorem  6.9. Let n ≥3and let X=2n
Ibe a 2-vertex  premaniplex  of rank n. Let I:= {0, 1, ..., n −1} \Ib e the set of the colors of the
links of X. Then, in any of the following  cases, Xis the symmetry-type  graph of a polytope.
•Ih a s exactly  1 or 2 elements.
•Ii s an interval  [k, m] ={k, k +1, ..., m}.
Theorem 6.9ensures  that of the total of 2n−1 premaniplexes  of rank nwith 2 vertices,  at least n2−n +1a r e the
symmetry  type of a polytope  (nwith 1 link, n(n−1)
2with 2 links and n(n−1)
2−n +1w i t h  an interval  of links of size at

least 3).  It appears  that there is still a long way to go. Nevertheless,  Theorem 6.4and Corollary 6.5ensure  that to prove that
there are polytopes  with symmetry  type 2n
I, one should  only check  that (4)i s satisﬁed  for k =1f o r the voltage  ξ(and this
would  imply  that it is also satisﬁed  for ξ/prime). Sadly,  the proof of Theorem 6.8cannot  be easily  generalized  to arbitrary  I. This
is because  the voltage  of a link of color 1 ≤i <nwould  be r0riand this affects  most arguments  used, mainly  because  there
would  be paths whose  voltage  change  0-faces  but they do not use the color 0. The author  of this paper  conjectures  that if
this challenge  is solved  for one example  2n
Iwith 3 or more links of non-consecutive  colors,  the same solution  must work
for all others,  and that would  prove that there exist 2-orbit  polytopes  of any possible  symmetry  type (and rank n ≥3).
