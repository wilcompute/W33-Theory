Abstract. A maniplex of rank nis a combinatorial object that generalises the notion of
a ranknabstract polytope. A maniplex with the highest possible deg ree of symmetry is
called reﬂexible. In this paper we prove that there is a rank 4 reﬂexible maniplex with
automorphism group PSL 2(q) for inﬁnitely many prime powers q, and that no reﬂexible
maniplex of rank n >4 exists that has PSL 2(q) as its full automorphism group.
1.Introduction
A maniplex is a combinatorial object that generalises the no tion of a map on a surface to
higherdimensions. Thus, maniplexes also generalise abstr actpolytopes in asimilar way that
maps generalise abstract and geometric polyhedra. As with m aps and abstract polytopes,
the study of maniplexes is essentially that of their symmetr ies, with much of the research
focusing on those objects exhibiting the highest possible d egree of symmetry. These are
typically called regular in the case of abstract polytopes, and reﬂexible, in the case of maps
and maniplexes. Informally, an abstract regular polytope h as an automorphism group that
is called a string C-group, namely a string group generated b y involutions satisfying an
intersection condition that ensures, among others, that th e polytope is strongly connected.
Meanwhile, the automorphism group of a reﬂexible maniplex o f ranknis also a string group
generated by involutions, but we do no require it to satisfy t he intersection property. In
this sense every regular abstract polytope is a reﬂexible ma niplex. However, this generali-
sation extends beyond regularity or reﬂexibility: every ab stract polytope, regardless of its
symmetry, is a maniplex. A charaterization of polytopality for maniplexes was given in [7].
Maniplexes were ﬁrst introduced in [22], and have since rece ived considerable attention (see
for instance [4, 6, 17, 18]).
Maps and abstract polytopes having a projective special lin ear group as its automorphism
group have been extensively studied. In particular, Sjerve and Cherkassov showed in [1] that
ifq/ne}ationslash= 2,3,7,9, then there exists a reﬂexible map with automorphism group PSL2(q). A
complete enumeration of maps (in the wider context of regula r hypermaps) having PSL 2(q)
as a subgroup of index k≤2 of their automorphism group was given in [2] by Conder et al. ,
extending the work of Macbeath [16] and Sah [19]. Roughly at t he same time, Leemans and
Schulte [12] showed that there exist exactly one regular abs tract polytopes of rank 4 with
automorphism group PSL 2(q) for each q∈ {11,19}, and that these are the only two regular
abstractpolytopesofrank4withaprojective special linea rgroupas theirfullautomorphism
group. Moreover, Leemans and Vauthier proved in [14] that fo rk≥5, there are no regular
abstract polytopes of rank kwith automorphism group PSL 2(q) for any primer power q.
In this paper, we extend the results of [1] and [12] by proving that there exists a reﬂexible
maniplex of rank 4 with automorphism group PSL 2(q) for inﬁnitely many odd primes q
and that no such maniplex exists if qis an even prime power. We show that any such

maniplex is either isomorphic to one of the two (polytopal) m aniplexes of [12], or it has a
single facet (alt. vertex). In the latter case, one of the two groups associated with the facet
and the vertex-ﬁgure is isomorphic to the whole automorphis m group PSL 2(q) while the
other is isomorphic to either A 5or PSL 2(q). Therefore such a maniplex (or its dual) has one
facet and either one or |PSL2(q)|/60 vertices. We construct an inﬁnite family of maniplexes
for each of the two aforementioned possibilities. We also sh ow that there are no reﬂexible
maniplexes of rank k≥5 with automorphim group PSL 2(q)
In Section 2 we formally deﬁne maniplexes and their relation to string groups generated
by involutions. In Section 3 we prove several auxiliary resu lts on the possible string group
representation for the groups PSL 2(q). In Section 4 we construct two inﬁnite families of
rank 4 maniplexes with automorphism group PSL 2(q) where qis an odd prime, and we
show that no such maniplex exist if qis an even prime power. Finally, in Section 5 we give
some concluding remarks.
2.Preliminary concepts
Given a set Ω, we denote by S Ωthe group of all permutations of the set Ω. We denote by
idthe permutation of S Ωﬁxing all elements of Ω. Sometimes we also write S nwheren=|Ω|
when the context is clear. For a prime power q, we let PSL 2(q), PGL 2(q) and SL 2(q) denote
the projective special linear group, the projective genera l linear group and the special linear
group of the vector space of dimension 2 over the ﬁnite ﬁeld of orderq, respectively. We let
D2kdenote the dihedral group of order 2 k.
For a positive integer n, amaniplex of rank n(also called an n-maniplex ) is a pair
M:= (F,(r0,r1,...,rn−1)) where Fis a non-empty set, whose elements are called ﬂags,
and each riis an involution in S Fwith the following properties:
(1)riandrirjare ﬁxed-point-free for all iandj/ne}ationslash=i;
(2) (rirj)2=idwhenever |i−j|>1;
(3) the action of the group Mon( M) =/an}bracketle{tr0,r1,...,rn−1/an}bracketri}htis transitive on F.
The group Mon( M) is called the monodromy group ofMand then-tuple (r0,...,rn−1)
is the (ordered) set of distinguished generators of Mon(M). For a ﬂag Φ and a permutation
r∈Mon(M), we let Φrdenote the image of Φ under r. In particular, for i∈ {0,...,n−1}
we call the ﬂag Φrithei-neighbour of Φ. Since each riis an involution, the “neighbour”
relation is symmetric. If two ﬂags Φ and Ψ are i-neighbours of one another we also say that
they are i-adjacent .
Remark 2.1. A rank3maniplex coincides with the notion of a map on a surface, and m aps
are sometimes deﬁned in purely combinational terms as a set o f three involutory permuta-
tions acting on a set (see [15]for example, where ﬂags are called ‘blades’). Given that the
notion of a map is fairly well-established, we will refer to 3-maniplexes simply as maps.
Fori∈ {0,...,n−1}ani-faceofMis an orbit of the subgroup Gi=/an}bracketle{trj|j/ne}ationslash=i/an}bracketri}htof
Mon(M) on its action on F. We call 0- and ( n−1)-face a vertexand afacet, respectively.
Consider the group Mon( M)+=/an}bracketle{trirj|i,j∈ {0,...,n−1}/an}bracketri}htand note that it has at most
two orbits on ﬂags. We say Misnon-orientable if Mon(M)+has a single orbit, and we say
it isorientable otherwise. In the latter case, each of the two orbits is calle d anorientation .
An automorphism of Mis a permutation of the ﬂags that maps i-adjacent ﬂags to i-
adjacent ﬂags for all i∈ {0,...,n−1}. The group of automorphisms of Mis denoted
Aut(M). Since automorphisms must preserve i-adjacencies, the actions of Aut( M) and
Mon(M) commute. That is, for every Φ ∈ F,α∈Aut(M) andr∈Mon(M) we have
PROJECTIVE MANIPLEXES 3
Φαr= Φrα. (1)
From this fact and from the transitivity of Mon( M), we see that an automorphism of
Mis completely determined by its image on a single ﬂag and thus the action of Aut( M)
is semiregular on F. We say Misreﬂexible if Aut(M) acts transitively on the ﬂags of M.
Note that in this case the action of Aut( M) on the ﬂags of Mmust also be regular, and
thus for any two ﬂags there exists a unique automorphism mapp ing one to the other.
2.1.String representations. We say a group Gis astring group generated by involutions ,
or asggifor short, if Gis generated by involutions g0,...,gn−1such that gigj=gjgiif
|i−j|>1. If there are npairwise distinct such involutions, then we say Gis of rank n
and then-tuple (g0,...,gn−1) is called a string representation ofGof rankn. Two string
representations ( g0,...,gn−1)and(g′
0,...,g′

a group automorphism φ:G→Gmapping each gitog′
i.
As it transpires, the automorphism group of a reﬂexible n-maniplex is a sggiof rank
n, and every rank n sggiis the automorphism group of a reﬂexible n-maniplex. Then,
determining the existence of rank n-maniplexes with a given group of automorphisms G
reduces to determining the possible rank nstring representations of G. Let us discuss the
relation between these two notions a little bit further.
LetMbe a reﬂexible nmaniplex, let I={0,...,n−1}and let Φ be a ﬁxed ﬂag of M.
Fori∈Iletρibe the unique automorphism of Msuch that Φρi= Φi. Ifα∈Aut(M)
then, by the transitivity of Mon( M), there exist i0,i1,...,ij∈Isuch that Φα= Φri0ri1...rij.
Since the action of Aut( M) and Mon( M) commute we have
Φα= Φri0ri1...rij= (Φρi0)ri1...rij= (Φri1...rij)ρi0=...= Φρijρij−1...ρi0,
and thus α=ρijρij−1...ρi0. It follows that {ρi|i∈I}is a generating set for Aut( M).
Moreover, if |i−j|>1, then Φρiρj= Φrjri= Φrirj= Φρjρiand thus ρiρj=ρjρi. Then
then-tuple (ρ0,ρ1,...,ρn−1) is a string representation of Aut( M). Note that we have
some freedom in choosing the base ﬂag Φ, and thus this string r epresentation is not unique.
However, all the diﬀerent string representations obtained b y considering diﬀerent ﬂags of
Mare conjugate in Gand are therefore isomorphic.
Conversely let Gbe a group with a string representation ( g0,g1,...,gn−1). Fori∈
{0,...,n−1}, deﬁnerias the permutation induced by gionGby left multiplication. It is
routine to check that M= (G,(r0,r1,...,rn−1)) is a regular n-maniplex with Aut( M)∼=
Mon(M)∼=G, and the actions of Mon( M) and Aut( M) are isomorphic to the left and
right regular actions of G, respectively. Furthermore, if we let Φ = 1 Gthen the string
representation of Gassociated to Mand Φ is precisely ( g0,...,gn−1).

3.String representations of PSL2(q)
The determination of the subgroup lattice of PSL 2(q) due to Dickson [5] (and revisited
by many authors such as [10, 21]) has become a central tool in s tudying the possible string

representations of projective special linear groups. In [1 ], it was shown that PSL 2(q) admits
a rank 3 string representation whenever q /∈ {2,3,7,9}. Later Leemans and Schulte [12]
proved that if q/ne}ationslash= 11,19, then PSL 2(q) does not admit a rank 4 string representation
(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3) satisfying the following additional intersection property :
∀J,K⊆ {0,1,2,3},/an}bracketle{tρj|j∈J/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tρk|k∈K/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tρj|j∈J∩K/an}bracketri}ht. (2)
String groups generated by involutions satisfying the inte rsection property above are
usually called stringC-groups, and are associated to regular abstract polytopes in much
the same way as an sggiis related to a reﬂexible maniplex. The intersection proper ty is
very restrictive in the sense that not many sggissatisfy it. While PSL 2(q) admits only two
rank 4 string representations with the intersection proper ty (one when q= 11 and one when
q= 19), it admits a string representation for inﬁnitely many v alues ofq.
Notethatallsuchrepresentationareofrank n≤4, asPSL 2(q)doesnotcontainsubgroups
that are the direct product of two dihedral subgroups or orde r 6 or larger. Indeed, if n >4
and (ρ0,...,ρn−1) is a string representation of PSL 2(q), then/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1/an}bracketri}htand/an}bracketle{tρn−2,ρn−1/an}bracketri}htare
dihedral of order at least 6 and they centralize each other, m aking their direct product
a subgroup of PSL 2(q). This was ﬁrst remarked in [14, Theorem 2] for string C-group
representations of PSL 2(q), but the same argument works here.
Our strategy to produce rank 4 string representations for PS L2(q) will be similar to that
used in [1] and [12]. We will make extensive use of the results of Dickson on the subgroup
lattice of PSL 2(q), summarized in Lemma 3.1 below. More detailed versions of t his theorem
can be found in [8, 12, 21].
Lemma 3.1. [5]Letq=prwherepis a prime power and ris a positive integer, and let H
be a proper non-abelian subgroup of PSL2(q). Then one the following holds:
(1)His a semidirect product of an elementary abelian group with a cyclic group;
(2)His a dihedral group;
(3)His a projective linear group isomorphic to PSL2(pa)witha|rorPGL2(pb)with
2b|r;
(4)His isomorphic to A4,S4orA5.
For the remainder of this section let G∼=PSL2(q),q >3, and let ( ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3) be a
string representation of G. For each i∈ {0,1,2,3}, letGi=/an}bracketle{tρj|j/ne}ationslash=i/an}bracketri}ht. We will often refer
toG0andG3as thevertex group andfacet group ofMrespectively. Observe that the group
G3cannot be abelian, for otherwise ρ0would lie in the centre of G, which is trivial. Then, if
G3is a proper subgroup of G, it must belong to one of the four classes of groups described
in Lemma 3.1. The main goal of this section is to show that if G3is a proper subgroup
then it is isomorphic to S 4or A5, by ruling out, one by one, all the other possibilities.
This is essentially the same strategy as that used in [12], bu t in the more general setting of
maniplexes (that is, of sggisthat do not necessarily satisfy the intersection property) . In
fact, we show that some of the results of [12] can be restated t o not require the intersection
property without changing the original proof too much, prov ided that we are careful. We
will need the following three auxiliary results, which can b e traced back in one form or
another to [5]. Lemma 3.3 is obtained by inspecting the list o f subgroups of PSL 2(q).
Lemma 3.2. [12, Lemma 3] The centre of a non-abelian subgroup of PSL2(q)has order at
most2.
Lemma 3.3. IfG∼=PSL2(q)andr∈Gis an involution, then the centralizer CG(r)is a
maximal subgroup of Gand is isomorphic to the dihedral group D2nfor some n∈ {q+1
2,q−1
2}.

Lemma 3.4. [12, Lemma 6] Letq=psfor some prime pands≥1and letG∼=PSL2(q).
Letq′|qandn∈ {q′+1
2,q′−1
2}. Ifk|nthen the following holds:
(1) every dihedral sugbroup D2k≤Gof order 2kis contained in exactly one dihedral
subgroup D2nof order 2n;
(2) every dihedral subgroup of order 2nis contained in exactly one subgroup of Giso-
morphic to PSL2(q′).
We will start by proving that G3is not the semidirect product of an elementary abelian
group with a cyclic group.
Lemma 3.5. If(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3)is a string representation of PSL2(q)then the order of ρiρi+1
is greater than 2for alli∈ {0,1,2}.
Proof.Suppose ρ0ρ1has order two. Then ρ0commutes with ρ1, but also with ρ2andρ3,
and thus ρ0lies in the center of PSL 2(q), a contradiction. By the same token, the order of
ρ2ρ3is greater than two. Finally if ( ρ1ρ2)2= 1Gthen PSL 2(q) =/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1/an}bracketri}ht×/an}bracketle{tρ2,ρ3/an}bracketri}ht, which
is impossible since PSL 2(q) is not the direct product of two dihedral subgroups. /square
This shows that G3contains a dihedral subgroup of order at least 6, namely, /an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1/an}bracketri}ht.
Since a semidirect product of an elementary abelian group wi th a cyclic group does not
contain dihedral groups of order larger than 4, we have the fo llowing corollary.
Corollary 3.6. G3is not a semidirect product of an elementary abelian group wi th a cyclic
group.
The next step is to show that G3cannot be a projective linear group. Compare Lemmas
3.7 and 3.8 with Lemmas 7 and 9 of [12].
Lemma 3.7. LetG∼=PSL2(q)and let(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3)be a rank 4string representation of
G. The subgroups G0=/an}bracketle{tρ1,ρ2,ρ3/an}bracketri}htandG3=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2/an}bracketri}htcannot be isomorphic to PSL2(q′)
withq′< q.
Proof.Suppose for a contradiction that G3∼=PSL2(q′) for some q′< q, and consider the
subgroup ( G3)ρ3. Note that G3/ne}ationslash= (G3)ρ3by the simplicity of G(asqmust be at least 4).
But then the dihedral group /an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1/an}bracketri}htlies in the intersection of G3and (G3)ρ3, both of which
are isomorphic to PSL 2(q′) and, by Lemma 3.4, G3= (G3)ρ3, a contradiction. /square
Lemma 3.8. LetG∼=PSL2(q)and let(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3)be a rank 4string representation of
G. The subgroups G0=/an}bracketle{tρ1,ρ2,ρ3/an}bracketri}htandG3=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2/an}bracketri}htcannot be isomorphic to PGL2(q′)
withq′< q.
Proof.Lemma 9 of [12] states that if G∼=PSL2(q) and (ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3) is a rank 4 string rep-
resentation of Gsatisfying the intersection property (2), then the subgrou pG3=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2/an}bracketri}ht
cannotbeisomorphicto PGL2(q′)withq′< q. However, therequirementthat ( ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3)
satisﬁes the intersection property is used only to show that the order of the element ρ0ρ1
is odd. Therefore, it suﬃces to show that ρ0ρ1has odd order and the result will follow
from the proof of [12, Lemma 9], which we omit here for brevity . IfG3=Gthen clearly
G3/ne}ationslash=PGL2(q′) withq′< q. Therefore we can assume G3is a proper subgroup of G, and in
particular ρ3/∈G3. Then the subgroup /an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ3/an}bracketri}htis isomorphic to D 2t×Z2wheretis the
order of ρ0ρ1. Iftis even, then the group D 2t×Z2is a non-abelian subgroup whose centre
has more than 2 elements, contradicting Lemma 3.2. /square
Lemma 3.9. LetG∼=PSL2(q)and letH≤Gbe a dihedral subgroup admitting a rank 3
string representation (ρ0,ρ1,ρ2). Ifρ3∈Gis an involution commuting with ρ0andρ1, then
the group /an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3/an}bracketri}htis a proper subgroup of G.
6 DIMITRI LEEMANS AND MICAEL TOLEDO
We give two distinct proofs of this lemma, one based on geomet ric arguments, the other
based on algebraic arguments.
Geometric proof. The group PSL 2(q) acting on its natural representation on q+ 1 points
sits inside PGL 2(q) which is sharply 3-transitive on these q+1 points.
Suppose that q≡1 mod4. Then all involutions of PSL 2(q) have two ﬁxed points. Also,
theonly maximal dihedralsubgroupscontaining pairs of inv olutions that commute areD q−1.
SoHmust be in a subgroup D q−1. The central involution of D q−1ﬁxes two points aand
b. Every non-central involution swaps these two points and ﬁx es two points of the q−1
remaining points. Say ρiﬁxesaiandbi. Forρ3to commute with ρ0andρ1it needs to swap
a0withb0and swap a1withb1. But the central involution of D q−1does that. As PGL 2(q) is
sharply 3-transitive, there is a unique element mapping thr ee points on three other points.
Here we have even more, four points. Hence, ρ3has to be that central involution and the
group/an}bracketle{tH,ρ3/an}bracketri}htis necessarily a subgroup of D q−1.
Suppose q≡3 mod4. Then PSL 2(q) can be seem as a subgroup of PSL 2(q2) withq2≡1
mod4 and we can apply the same argument as above on q2+1 points.
Finally, suppose that qis even. Then commuting involutions necessarily have a ﬁxed
point in common and Hmust be an elementary abelian group of order 4. Moreover, /an}bracketle{tH,ρ3/an}bracketri}ht
will also necessarily be an elementary abelian group, not PS L2(q). /square
Algebraic proof. Suppose that ρ3∈PSL2(q) is an involution satisfying ( ρ0ρ3)2= (ρ1ρ3)2=
1G. We will show that K=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3/an}bracketri}htcannot be the whole PSL 2(q). Note that if ρ0
andρ1commute, then ρ0lies in the center of Kand soK/ne}ationslash= PSL 2(q). Suppose ρ0andρ1
do not commute. Then D:=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1/an}bracketri}htis a dihedral subgroup of H=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2/an}bracketri}htof order
larger than 4. Since ρ0andρ1lie in the centraliser Cofρ3in PSL 2(q), thenD≤C. By
Lemma 3.3, Cis a maximal dihedral subgroup of PSL 2(q). Furthermore, by Lemma 3.4,
every dihedral subgroup of PSL 2(q) lies inside a unique maximal dihedral subgroup. Let ¯H
be the maximal dihedral subgroup containing H. ThenD≤¯H∩Cand thus ¯H=C. In
particular, this shows that ρ2∈Cand thus K=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3/an}bracketri}ht ≤C/lessnotequalPSL2(q). /square
We now have all the results necessary to prove the main theore m of this section.
Theorem 3.10. Letqbe a prime power and let G∼=PSL2(q). If(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3)is a string
representation of G, then the subgroup G3=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2/an}bracketri}htis isomorphic to S4,A5orG.
Proof.Suppose G3is a proper subgroup of G. SinceG3is non-abelian, one of the four items
of Lemma 3.1 must hold for G3. By Corollary 3.6 and Lemmas 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 we see that
G3must be isomorphic to either A 4, S4or A5. However A 4admits no string representation
of rank 3 [1]. This leaves only S 4and A5as possibilities for G3. /square
4.Reflexible 4-maniplexes with group PSL2(q)
LetM:= (G,(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3)) be a reﬂexible 4-maniplex with G∼=PSL2(q) for some prime
powerq. ThedualofMis the maniplex M∗= (G,(ρ3,ρ2,ρ1,ρ0)). By applying Theorem
3.10 toM∗we see that the group G0=/an}bracketle{tρ3,ρ2,ρ1/an}bracketri}htis isomorphic to S 4, A5orG. Hence
there are essentially three distinct possibilities for M, depending on what the groups G0
andG3may look like.
Remark 4.1. One of the following holds for M:
(1)G0∼=G3∼=G;
(2) Exactly one of G0orG3is isomorphic to Gand the other is isomorphic to either
S4orA5;
PROJECTIVE MANIPLEXES 7
(3) Both G0andG3are isomorphic to a group in {S4,A5}.
If for some i∈ {1,2,3}item (i) of Remark 4.1 above holds for M, then we will say M
belongs to Class i. Note that if q >3, then PSL 2(q) is a simple group, and thus Mis
necessarily non-orientable, regardless of the class to whi ch it belongs, as its automorphism
group contains no subgroup of index 2.
We will show in Lemma 4.5 and Proposition 4.7 that Classes (1) and (2) are inﬁnite.
Meanwhile, Class (3), which is comprised of exactly two mani plexes, was dealt with in [12],
in the context of abstract regular polytopes. In particular , [12, Theorem 3] states that if
G∼=PSL2(q) and (ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3) is a string C-group representation of Gsuch that each of
G3andG0is isomorphic to either S 4or A5, thenq∈ {11,19}and for each of the two
possible values of q, the string C-group representation of Gis unique (up to isomorphism).
However one can readily check that the intersection propert y is not used in the proof of
[12, Theorem 3] and thus the result holds in the more general c ase where ( ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3) is
a string representation. We then obtain the following propo sition (see [9, 3] for a deﬁnition
of the 11- and 57-cell respectively).
Proposition 4.2. IfMis a reﬂexible 4-maniplex in Class (3), then q= 11andMis
isomorphic to the 11-cell orq= 19andMis isomorphic to the 57-cell. In both cases
G0∼=G3∼=A5.
Proposition 4.2 and Remark 4.1 combined give us the followin g important result.
Lemma 4.3. There are no reﬂexible 4-maniplexes with automorphism group PSL2(2k).
Proof.LetG= PSL 2(q) withq= 2k. Note that if k= 1, then G= PSL 2(2)∼=S3and
clearlyGdoes not admit a rank 4 string representation. We can hencefo rth assume that
k >1 and thus q≥4, forcing Gto be a simple group.
Suppose for a contradiction that Gadmits a string representation ( ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3). Recall
that when qis even, PSL 2(q) = PGL 2(q). Since qis even, then by Remark 4.1 and Propo-
sition 4.2, we can assume without loss of generality that G3:=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2/an}bracketri}htis isomorphic to
G.
Consider the natural action of Gonq+ 1 points. Since qis even and Gis sharply 3-
transitive, every involution in Gﬁxes exactly one point (as if it ﬁxes more points, it must
ﬁx at least three and the only element ﬁxing three points is 1 G), and two involutions that
commute must have the same ﬁxed point. Let xbe the point ﬁxed by ρ0andρ3. Asρ0
(resp.ρ1) andρ2(resp.ρ3) commute, ρ2(resp.ρ1) also ﬁxes x. Hence /an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3/an}bracketri}ht ≤
Gx< G. /square
We say a reﬂexible n-maniplex Misextendible if there is an ( n+1)-maniplex M′whose
facets are all isomorphic to M. The maniplex M′is then called an extension ofM.
LetM= (G,(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3) be a reﬂexible 4-maniplex with G∼=PSL2(q). Observe that
M3:= (G3,(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2)) is a reﬂexible map (a 3-maniplex) in its own right, and ever y facet
ofMis isomorphic to M3. Then, Mis an extension of M3. In particular, in light of
Theorem 3.10, Mmust be an extension of a reﬂexible map whose full automorphi sm group
is either S 4, A5or PSL 2(q).
Theorem 4.4. Letq=pkwherepis an odd prime, let α∈ {−1,1}be such that q≡α
(mod4) and letn=q−α
2. For an odd divisor kofn, every reﬂexible map on PSL2(q)of
type{k,x},x≥3, is extendible.
Proof.LetM= (PSL 2(q),(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2)) be a regular map of type {k,x}for an odd divisor k
ofnand some integer x≥3. Then the order of ρ0ρ1iskandH:=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1/an}bracketri}htis a dihedral

group of order 2 k. By Lemma 3.4 His contained in a subgroup D <PSL2(q) isomorphic to
the dihedral group D 2n. Sincenis even,Dcontains a central involution ρ3, which commutes
withρ0andρ1. Note that ρ3/ne}ationslash=ρ2, sinceρ2does not commute with ρ1. Moreover ρ3/∈H,
sinceHhas order 2 kandkis odd. We conclude that (PSL 2(q),(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3)) is a rank 4
extension of M. /square
Our next task is to construct a inﬁnite family of reﬂexible 4- maniplexes contained in each
of the classes 1 and 2. We will make use of Dirichlet’s Theorem stating that if aandbare
two coprime integers, then there are inﬁnitely many prime nu mbers congruent to amodulo
b.
4.1.Class 1.
Lemma 4.5. Letpbe a prime such that p≡1 (mod12) . Then there exists a reﬂexible map
Mof type{3,p}with automorphism group PSL2(p)admitting a reﬂexible non-orientable
extension ¯Msuch that Aut(¯M) = PSL 2(p). Moreover, ¯Mbelongs to Class 1.
Proof.We will show that Mexists by providing an explicit set of generators for its au-
tomorphism group. Let a∈GF(p) be such that a2=−1 (since p≡1 (mod4)) such an
element always exists) and consider the following matrices in SL2(p).
ρ0=/parenleftbigg
0 1
−1 0/parenrightbigg
ρ1=/parenleftbigg
a0
1−a/parenrightbigg
ρ2=/parenleftbigg
−a0
0a/parenrightbigg
For each ρi, letρibe the corresponding image in PSL 2(p) under the quotient projection
π: SL2(q)→PSL2(q). Observe that ( ρi)2= 1 for all i∈ {0,1,2}and that ( ρ0ρ2)2=
(ρ0ρ1)3= 1. Moreover, for an integer kwe have
(ρ1ρ2)k=/parenleftbigg
1 0
−ka1/parenrightbigg
.
and thus ρ1ρ2has order p. We must show that group G:=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2/an}bracketri}htis isomorphic to
PSL2(p). Since G≤PSL2(q) andGis non-abelian, it suﬃces to show that Gis not of any
of the four possible types of proper non-abelian subgroups o f PSLq(p) given in Lemma 3.1.
First, note that since pis prime, PSL 2(p) has no proper projective linear subgroups. Now,
Gcontains a dihedral subgroup /an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1/an}bracketri}htof order 6, and thus Gis not a semidirect product of
an elementary abelian group with a cyclic group. To see that Gcannot be dihedral, recall
that in a dihedral group the product of two non-central invol utions that commute must
be the central element of the group. However, ρ0ρ2is not central in Gsince it does not
commutewith ρ1. Finally, Gis not isomorphicto A 5or S4sinceρ1ρ2hasorder p≥13. Then
G= PSL 2(p) andM:= (G,(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2)) is areﬂexiblemapof type {3,p}withautomorphism
group PSL 2(p).
Now, 3divides( p−1)/2andbyTheorem4.4thereexistsa ρ3∈Gsuchthat( G,(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3))
isareﬂexible4-maniplexwithautomorphismgroup G. Itremainstoshowthat( G,(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3))
belongs to Class 1. Clearly G0=/an}bracketle{tρ1,ρ2,ρ3/an}bracketri}htis not isomorphic to A 5or S4since it contains
an element of order pand by Theorem 3.10, G0∼=PSL2(p) and thus G0=G3=G, as
desired. /square
Since there are inﬁnitely many prime numbers congruent to 1 m odulo 12, we obtain the
following corollary.
Corollary 4.6. There are inﬁnitely many reﬂexible 4-maniplexes in Class 1.
PROJECTIVE MANIPLEXES 9
4.2.Class 2.
Proposition 4.7. Letp/ne}ationslash= 19be a prime and suppose that for α∈ {−1,1},p≡α(mod20) .
Then there exists a reﬂexible 4-maniplex Mwith automorphism group PSL2(p).
Proof.LetG= PSL 2(p) andn= (p−α)/2. Observe that, because of our choice of p,G
admits a maximal subgroup Aisomorphic to A 5. It is well known that Acan be generated
by three involutions ρ0,ρ1andρ2such that ρ0ρ2=ρ2ρ0and the orders of ρ0ρ1andρ1ρ2
are 5 and 3 respectively [1]. The group H=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1/an}bracketri}htis isomorphic to D 10and is thus
contained in a maximal subgroup DofGisomorphic to D 2n. Sincenis even,Dcontains
a non-trivial central involution ρ3. Now, the centralizers of two non-commuting involutions
in A5must have trivial intersection and thus ρ3/∈A. Then, by the maximality of A,
we see that G=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3/an}bracketri}htand thus ( G,(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2,ρ3)) is a reﬂexible 4-maniplex with
automorphism group G= PSL 2(p). /square
The reﬂexive 4-maniplex constructed in Proposition 4.7 bel ongs to Class 2. To see this,
ﬁrst note that G0:=/an}bracketle{tρ1,ρ2,ρ3/an}bracketri}htmust be PSL 2(p). Indeed, by Theorem 3.10, G0is iso-
morphic to S 4, A5or PSL 2(p). Since p /∈ {11,19}andAis alternating, by Proposition
4.2,G0cannot be isomorphic to S 4or A5. Hence, G0= PSL q(p) and by construction
G3:=/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2/an}bracketri}htis isomoprhic to A 5. Therefore, Mis in Class 2. Moreover, Mis an
extension of the reﬂexible map M3:= (G3,(ρ0,ρ1,ρ2)) of type {5,3}isomorphic to the
hemi-dodecahdron. Since there are inﬁnitely many primes co ngruent to ±1 modulo 20, the
construction of Proposition 4.7 gives us inﬁnitely many man iplexes
Corollary 4.8. There are inﬁnitely many reﬂexible 4-maniplexes in Class 2.
5.Remarks on Suzuki groups and PGL2(q)
Some of the strategies used in this paper may also prove usefu l when looking at other
families of groups. Consider, for instance, the case of Suzu ki groups (see [20] for deﬁnition
and details). For an odd power of 2 q= 22n+1, the Suzuki group Sz( q) can be seen as a
doubly-transitive permutation group acting on a set Ω of siz eq2+1. With this action, all
involutions of Sz( q) ﬁx exactly one point of Ω and two involutions commute if and o nly if
they have same ﬁxed point. Hence, the argument used in Lemma 4 .3 shows that there are
no reﬂexible maniplexes of rank nwith full automorphism group isomorphic to a Suzuki
group if n >3.
Although left out of the scope of this paper, maniplexes havi ng a projective general linear
group as their full automorphism group can also be tackled by following the same strategy
used here. Indeed, since for every prime power qwe have PSL 2(q)≤PGL2(q)<PSL2(q2),
the subgroup structure of PGL 2(q) is well understood (see for instance [13] for a detailed
list). In particular a proper non-abelian subgroup of PGL 2(q) must be either A 4, S4, A5or
PSL2(q). Thus,uptoduality, thefacetgroupofamaniplexofrank nwithfullautomorphism
group PGL 2(q) must be isomorphic to S 4, A5, PSL2(q) or PGL 2(q). As PGL 2(q) does not
admit a rank nstring group representation for n >4, the maximum rank for a reﬂexible
maniplex with automorphism group PGL 2(q) is 4. A computer assisted search for rank 4
maniplexes with automorphism group PGL 2(q) for small values of qsuggests that the 4-
simplex is the only 4-maniplex having proper subgroups of PS L2(q) as its vertex and facet
groups(it isknownthat it istheonly regularabstract polyt opeofrank4withautomorphism
group PGL 2(q) [13]). For all other 4-maniplexes found (up to duality), th e facet group is
isomorphic to PGL 2(q) while the vertex group is one of S 4, A5, PSL2(q) or PGL 2(q), with
10 DIMITRI LEEMANS AND MICAEL TOLEDO
all four possibilities occurring. We conjecture that there is an inﬁnite family of rank 4
maniplexes for all four of the aforementioned possibilitie s for the vertex group.
