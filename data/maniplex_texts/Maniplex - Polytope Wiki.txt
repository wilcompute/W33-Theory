Polytope WikiManiplexA maniplex is a combinatorial model of polytopes.
{3,2}π is aregularmaniplex butnot anabstractpolytope.Maniplexes can be thought of as complexes with a version of dyadicityor as abstract polytopes without necessarily satisfying the intersectionproperty.5/20/25, 2:38 AMPage 1 of 11
Edge-colored graphA n -maniplex is a properly edge-colored simple graph with thefollowing:It is connected. (i.e. it is acomplex)If |i-j| > 1, then every path oflength 4 which alternatesbetween i  and j  edges is a cycle.Permutation sequenceDefinition5/20/25, 2:38 AMPage 2 of 11
An n -maniplex is tuple , where Ω  is a set, and A  is a sequenceof n  permutations on Ω , :1.  is a complex.2. For any subfacet of thecomplex (orbit of elementsunder ),a , the image of a  under is also a subfacet.3. Every facet of the complex isa maniplex.The second requirement can be seen as a form of dyadicity. Informallyit states that two facets meet at each subfacet (ridge). However it isimportant to note that because maniplexes retain more informationthan just incidence the same facet of a maniplex can meet itself at aridge.5/20/25, 2:38 AMPage 3 of 11
Abstract polytopesManiplexes can be seen as a generalization of abstract polytopes. Inparticular, the flag graph of every abstract polytope is a maniplex.The key difference between maniplexes and abstract polytopes is howthe diamond property is interpreted. The traditional definition ofabstract polytopes constructs them as posets. This means that anypair of elements are either incident or not, there is no way for anelement to be incident with another element in two ways, e.g. a facewhich shares an edge with itself. Maniplexes however allow a finergrained specification of the topological structure. In a polytope twofacets meeting at a ridge must be different facets, but maniplexes allowelements to be incident in multiple ways thus the same facet can meetat a ridge twice.A maniplex is polytopal if it is the flag graph of some abstractpolytope. Both of the following conditions on maniplexes are equivalentto being polytopal:[1]:Related concepts5/20/25, 2:38 AMPage 4 of 11
The strong path intersectionproperty (SPIP): For any twoflags Φ  and Ψ , if there is a pathfrom Φ  to Ψ  using only edgeswith colors in a set I , and a pathusing only colors from J , thenthere is a path from Φ  to Ψ  usingonly edges with colors in the setI ∩ J.The weak path intersectionproperty (WPIP): For any twoflags Φ  and Ψ , if there is a path5/20/25, 2:38 AMPage 5 of 11
from Φ  to Ψ  using only edgeswith rank less than some m , anda path using only edges withrank greater than some k , thenthere is a path from Φ  to Ψ  usingonly edges with rank in betweenm  and k .Thus an abstract polytope can be defined as a maniplex that satisfieseither of these properties. These properties generalize the intersectionproperty from abstract regular polytopes, and regular maniplexes arewhat you get when you relax the intersection property form thedefinition of abstract regular polytopes.The extension to maniplexes resolves a number of issues with abstractpolytopes:The mix of two abstract regular5/20/25, 2:38 AMPage 6 of 11
