Stratiﬁed operations on maniplexes
Gabe Cunningham, Daniel Pellicer & Gordon Williams
Abstract There is an increasingly extensive literature on the problem of describing the con-
nection (monodromy) groups and automorphism groups of families of polytopes and maniplexes
that are not regular or reﬂexible. Many such polytopes and maniplexes arise as the result of
constructions such as truncations and products. Here we show that for a wide variety of these
constructions, the connection group of the output can be described in a nice way in terms of
the connection group of the input. We call such operations stratiﬁed . Moreover, we show that,
ifFis a maniplex operation in one of two broad subclasses of stratiﬁed operations, and if Ris
the smallest reﬂexible cover of some maniplex M, then the connection group of F(R)is equal
to the connection group of F(M). In particular, we show that this is true for truncations and
medials of maps, for products of polytopes (including pyramids and prisms over polytopes),
and for the mix of maniplexes. As an application, we determine the smallest reﬂexible covers
of the pyramids over the equivelar toroidal maps.
1.Introduction
Maniplexes are combinatorial structures that simultaneously generalize maps on sur-
faces to structures of ranks higher than 3, and abstract polytopes to structures where
faces may self-intersect (see [39]). A maniplex is assembled from a set Ωofﬂags, and
can either be viewed as an action of a permutation group on Ω, or as a graph with
vertex set Ω, subject to some structural restrictions. Symmetry of maniplexes is mea-
sured by the number of orbits of ﬂags under the action of the automorphism group.
In that sense, the most symmetric maniplexes are the reﬂexible ones, which are those
having only one ﬂag orbit. In the context of maps and polytopes, reﬂexibility of these
objects as maniplexes is equivalent to their being regular.
There are many works discussing regular maps (see for example [25, 30, 35]) and
regular polytopes (see for example [4, 5, 12, 17, 36]). On the other hand, only a
few classes of non-regular maps and polytopes have been systematically analyzed,
highlighting the need for more techniques to study such objects.
Every maniplex is a quotient of some reﬂexible maniplexes. This connection sug-
gests that part of the theory of reﬂexible maniplexes can be used to describe non-
reﬂexible maniplexes as well. Among all reﬂexible maniplexes that cover a given ma-
niplexM, there is one minimal cover src(M)with respect to the partial order given

by the quotient relationship (for more details, see Section 2). (Here “src” stands for
“smallest reﬂexible cover”.) It is to be expected that much of the information that can
be obtained by viewing Mas a quotient of a reﬂexible maniplex, can be obtained by
viewingMas a quotient of src(M).
The maniplex src(M)is often described in terms of speciﬁc generators of some per-
mutation group on the ﬂags of M(called the connection group ofM). This provides
a recipe to construct src(M)for individual ﬁnite maniplexes Mwhose set of ﬂags is
relatively small. Describing src(M)for an inﬁnite maniplex Mor for every maniplex
Min an inﬁnite family of maniplexes turns out to be complicated in general.
In the last decade, many publications have studied src(M)for various families of
non-reﬂexible maniplexes M, providing some ideas on how to work with the smallest
reﬂexible cover src(M)(see [1, 2, 18, 28, 33, 34]).
Thepresentarticleismotivatedbyoperationsthatcanbeperformedonmaniplexes
in order to obtain other maniplexes. Given such an operation Fand a maniplexM,
it would be desirable to be able to construct src(F(M))fromF,Mandsrc(M). We
introduce the concept of a stratiﬁed operation that groups together many of the usual
operationsonmaniplexes.Wethenshowthatif Fisastratiﬁedoperationandsatisﬁes
an additional mild hypothesis, then src(F(M))∼=src(F(src(M)))(see Theorems 3.9
and 3.21). These results imply that if Fis a suitable stratiﬁed operation and we
already know how to compute src(F(R))for all reﬂexible maniplexes R, then we have
already solved the problem of computing src(F(M))as long as we know src(M).
The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we review deﬁnitions and basic
results on maniplexes. We motivate, state and prove our main result in Section 3,
where we also provide a list of stratiﬁed operations that have already appeared in
published works. In Section 4 we show an application of our main theorem; we choose
Fto be the operation of taking the pyramid over a maniplex, and show for which
equivelar maps on the torus Mthe maniplex src(F(M))is an abstract polytope. This
extends one of the main results in [34], which was stated only for the case where M
is a regular polytope. Another application of our main result is shown in Section 5,
where the theorem is used to determine properties of src(F(R))for some reﬂexible
maniplexRin terms of src(F(M))for some non-reﬂexible maniplex Msuch that
R= src(M). Finally, Section 6 contains proofs that some of the maniplex operations
from the literature are indeed stratiﬁed operations.
2.Maniplexes and polytopes
In this section we recall the deﬁnitions of maniplex and polytope, together with some
previously known results about them. For further details we refer to [27] and [29].
2.1.Maniplexes. The concept of maniplex was ﬁrst deﬁned in [39] as a combinato-
rial object generalizing the combinatorial aspects of maps on surfaces. They can be
described in several equivalent ways; here we ﬁnd the following deﬁnition convenient.
Amaniplex ofrankn(orn-maniplex ) is a pairM= (Ω,[r0,...,rn−1])where Ωis a
set whose elements are called ﬂags, and for every iwe have that riis a ﬁxed-point-free
involution on Ωsatisfying the following properties:
• /angbracketleftr0,...,rn−1/angbracketrightacts transitively on Ω,
•if|i−j|>2thenrirj=rjri,
•ifi/negationslash=jthenriandrjhave no transpositions in common.
The group/angbracketleftr0,...,rn−1/angbracketrightis called the connection group ofM, it is denoted Conn(M),
and its elements are called connections . Elsewhere Conn(M)is also called the mon-
odromy group of M. By convention, Conn(M)acts on Ωon the left.

Stratiﬁed operations on maniplexes
We can also represent an n-maniplex by its ﬂag graph , which is an edge-labeled
graph whose vertex-set is the set of ﬂags Ω, and where two vertices are connected
with an edge of label iif and only if riinterchanges those ﬂags. Then the restrictions
above imply that the ﬂag graph has no loops or multiple edges, that it is connected,
and that whenever |i−j|>2, then the full subgraph consisting of edges of label i
andjis a union of disjoint 4-cycles. Given an n-regular graph that satisﬁes these
conditions, we may recover the permutations rifrom the perfect matching consisting
of edges of label i, and so we may identify an n-maniplex with its ﬂag graph.
WhenMis a map on a surface, the set Ωconsists of the triangles in the barycentric
subdivision ofM, and each triangle represents a ﬂag. The involution r0swaps each
ﬂag with the neighbouring triangle across the segment between the center of the face
and the midpoint of the edge, r1is the involution that swaps each ﬂag with the
neighbouring triangle across the segment between the vertex and the center of the
face, andr2is the involution that swaps each ﬂag with the neighbouring triangle
across the edge. The ﬂags labeled 0,1and2in Figure 1 correspond to the images of
the gray ﬂag under r0,r1andr2, respectively.
STRATIFIED OPERATIONS ON MANIPLEXES
•ifi̸=jthen riandrjhave no transpositions in common.
The group ⟨r0, . . . , r n−1⟩is called the connection group ofM, it is denoted Conn( M),
and its elements are called connections . Elsewhere Conn( M) is also called the mon-
odromy group of M. By convention, Conn( M) acts on Ω on the left.
We can also represent an n-maniplex by its flag graph , which is an edge-labeled
graph whose vertex-set is the set of flags Ω, and where two vertices are connected
with an edge of label iif and only if riinterchanges those flags. Then the restrictions
above imply that the flag graph has no loops or multiple edges, that it is connected,
and that whenever |i−j|⩾2, then the full subgraph consisting of edges of label i
andjis a union of disjoint 4-cycles. Given an n-regular graph that satisfies these
conditions, we may recover the permutations rifrom the perfect matching consisting
of edges of label i, and so we may identify an n-maniplex with its flag graph.
When Mis a map on a surface, the set Ω consists of the triangles in the barycentric
subdivision of M, and each triangle represents a flag. The involution r0swaps each
flag with the neighbouring triangle across the segment between the center of the face
and the midpoint of the edge, r1is the involution that swaps each flag with the
neighbouring triangle across the segment between the vertex and the center of the
face, and r2is the involution that swaps each flag with the neighbouring triangle
across the edge. The flags labeled 0, 1 and 2 in Figure 1 correspond to the images of
the gray flag under r0,r1andr2, respectively.

Figure 1. The action of the connections r0,r1andr2.
The connection group is defined as a permutation group on the set of flags. Its
structure as an abstract group may be hard to understand from the maniplex itself.
This has motivated the study of the connection groups of certain families of maniplexes
in the previous decade (see for example [1], [2], [18], [17], [33]).
Given any flag Φ and i∈ {0, . . . , n −1}we may also denote riΦ by Φi, and say
that Φ and Φiareadjacent (ori-adjacent if we want to emphasize i).
The faces of a maniplex are defined by extending the notion of the faces of a map.
Thei-faces are the orbits of ⟨rj:j̸=i⟩. Furthermore, if FiandFjare an i-face and a
j-face, respectively, then Fi⩽Fjif and only if i⩽jandFi∩Fj̸=∅. In this way the
faces of a maniplex form a partially ordered set with a rank function. Note, however,
that the partially ordered set of faces may not capture all of the information about
the maniplex – see Section 3 in [14].
For some purposes we may fix a base flag Φ of a maniplex M. In that case we say
thatMisrooted at Φ. In other words, a rooted maniplex is a pair consisting of a
maniplex and one of its flags.
For convenience we denote by Mnthe class of all n-maniplexes.
2.2.Polytopes. Anabstract polytope of rank n(orn-polytope ) is a partially ordered
set (poset , for short) with a strictly increasing rank function in the range {−1, . . . , n }
that satisfies some of the main properties of the face-lattices of convex polytopes.

For some purposes we may ﬁx a base ﬂag Φof a maniplexM. In that case we say
thatMisrootedatΦ. In other words, a rooted maniplex is a pair consisting of a
maniplex and one of its ﬂags.
For convenience we denote by Mnthe class of all n-maniplexes.
2.2.Polytopes. Anabstract polytope ofrankn(orn-polytope ) is a partially ordered
set (poset, for short) with a strictly increasing rank function in the range {−1,...,n}
that satisﬁes some of the main properties of the face-lattices of convex polytopes.
Namely, it has a unique maximum Fnof ranknand a unique minimum F−1of
rank−1, and it satisﬁes the diamond condition and strong ﬂag-connectivity deﬁned
below. The elements of rank iare calledi-faces.

A poset having a rank function with range {−1,...,n}satisﬁes the diamond condi-
tionif for every i∈{0,...,n−1}, for every (i−1)-faceFi−1and for every (i+1)-face
Fi+1such thatFi−16Fi+1, there exist precisely two i-facesFandF/primesuch that
Fi−16F,F/prime6Fi+1.
The maximal totally ordered subsets of a poset (P,6)are called ﬂags. If(P,6)has
a strictly increasing rank function then all ﬂags have the same size. Furthermore, if
(P,6)satisﬁesthediamondconditionthenforeveryﬂag Φandeveryi∈{0,...,n−1}
there exists a unique ﬂag Φithat diﬀers from Φonly in itsi-face. We say that Φiand
Φareadjacent, ori-adjacent if we want to stress the rank i.
A poset satisfying the diamond condition is said to be strongly ﬂag-connected if
for every two ﬂags ΦandΨ, there exists a sequence Φ = Φ 0,..., Φk= Ψof ﬂags
such that any two consecutive ﬂags are adjacent and such that Φ∩Ψ⊆Φjfor every
j∈{1,...,k−1}.
The face-lattices of convex polytopes are abstract polytopes, but there are abstract
polytopesthatarenottheface-latticesofconvexpolytopes.Examplesofthisaremaps
on surfaces of genera at least 1such that the closure of every face is homeomorphic
to a disk.
Since this paper is devoted to maniplexes and abstract polytopes, unless explicitly
clariﬁed, in what follows we refer to abstract polytopes simply by “polytopes”.
Every polytopePmay be interpreted as a maniplex via its ﬂag graphFG(P), that
is, an edge-labelled graph whose vertices are the ﬂags of P, two of which are adjacent
by an edge with label iif and only if the corresponding ﬂags are i-adjacent. The
diamond condition ensures that the edges of each color form a perfect matching, and
hence we may deﬁne the involution rias the permutation that swaps every ﬂag with
itsi-adjacent ﬂag. The partially ordered set of faces of Pcan be recovered naturally
from its ﬂag graph, and hence we may abuse notation and use Pto denote both the
partially ordered set and the corresponding maniplex.
Not every maniplex is a polytope. For example, a 3-maniplex may have a face
incident to only one edge and one vertex, which violates the diamond condition. We
say that a maniplex is polytopal if the corresponding poset is a polytope.
2.3.Symmetry. Most of the study on maniplexes and abstract polytopes has been
devoted to those that possess a high degree of symmetry.
Anautomorphism of a maniplexM= (Ω,[r0,...,rn−1])is a permutation of Ω
whose action commutes with that of /angbracketleftr0,...,rn−1/angbracketright. If we represent Mas its ﬂag
graph then the automorphisms of Mare the automorphisms of the graph that ﬁx the
sets of edges corresponding to each label. If Mis a polytope then the automorphisms
are precisely the order-preserving permutations of the faces.
We denote the automorphism group of MbyΓ(M), and follow the convention
that it acts on the right. This has the convenient advantage that (wΦ)γ=w(Φγ)for
every ﬂag Φ, everyw∈Conn(M)and everyγ∈Γ(M).
The transitivity of the action of Conn(M)implies that every automorphism is
completely determined by the image of any ﬂag. As a consequence, Γ(M)acts semi-
regularly on the ﬂags of M.
A maniplexMis said to be reﬂexible ifΓ(M)acts transitively (and hence, reg-
ularly) on the set of ﬂags. If Γ(M)induceskorbits on the set of ﬂags we say that
Mis ak-orbit maniplex. Polytopes for which Γ(M)acts transitively on its ﬂags are
regular.
Astring group generated by involutions (sggi for short) is a group generated by a
list of involutions where every two involutions that are not consecutive in the list com-
mute. A string C-group is an sggi/angbracketleftr0,...,rn−1/angbracketrightwhere for every I,J⊆{0,...,n−1}
Algebraic Combinatorics , Vol. 5 #2 (2022) 270
Stratiﬁed operations on maniplexes
we have that
/angbracketleftrk:k∈I/angbracketright∩/angbracketleftrk:k∈J/angbracketright=/angbracketleftrk:k∈I∩J/angbracketright.
The automorphism group of every reﬂexible n-maniplexMis an sggi Γ(M) =
/angbracketleftρ0,...,ρn−1/angbracketright, whereρiis the automorphism mapping a ﬁxed base ﬂag ΦtoΦi. If
Mis a regular polytope then Γ(M)is a string C-group. Conversely, given a string
C-group Γ =/angbracketleftρ0,...,ρn−1/angbracketrightthere exists a unique regular abstract n-polytopePsuch
that Γ(P) = Γand with the property that there exists a ﬂag Φsuch that Φρi= Φi
for everyi. The basei-faceFiis taken to be the parabolic subgroup /angbracketleftρj:j/negationslash=i/angbracketrightand
the remaining i-faces are the cosets Fiγwithγ∈Γ. Face incidence is then deﬁned as
non-trivial intersection of the cosets.
The proof of the following theorem is essentially the same as that of [29, Theo-
rem 3.9].
Theorem 2.1.LetMbe a reﬂexible n-maniplex with Γ(M) =/angbracketleftρ0,...,ρn−1/angbracketrightand
connection group Conn(M) =/angbracketleftr0,...,rn−1/angbracketright. Then there is an isomorphism between
Γ(M)andConn(M)mapping each ρitori.
We shall denote by Wnthe universal string Coxeter group of rank n, that is, the
group with presentation
(1) /angbracketlefts0,...,sn−1: (sisj)pi,j=id/angbracketright,
wherepi,i= 1,pi,j= 2if|i−j|>2, andpi,j=∞if|i−j|= 1. It is well-known
thatWnis a string C-group and hence it is the automorphism group of the universal
polytopeP(Wn)of rankn. Note thatP(Wn)is regular.
2.4.Smallest reflexible covers. Acovering from a maniplex M1=
(Ω1,[r0,...,rn−1])to a maniplexM2= (Ω 2,[r/prime
0,...,r/prime
n−1])is a function η: Ω1→Ω2
such that (riΦ)η=r/prime
i(Φη)for every Φ∈Ω1and everyi. Such a function is necessarily
surjective. Coverings are also called rap-maps (rank and adjacency preserving maps).
Ifηis a covering from M1toM2we say thatM1is acoverofM2, thatM1covers
M2, or thatM2is aquotient ofM1.
Every maniplex is covered by at least one reﬂexible maniplex. For instance, every
n-maniplexMis covered by the universal n-polytopeP(Wn). This is a consequence
of Theorem 2.1, since the connection group of every n-maniplex satisﬁes the relations
in the presentation (1).
Coverings by reﬂexible maniplexes provide us with useful tools to better under-
stand connection groups of non-reﬂexible maniplexes. The following proposition is
the version for maniplexes of [29, Proposition 3.11], and it can be proven in the same
way as the proposition in that article.
Proposition 2.2.LetL= (ΩL,[r/prime
0,...,r/prime
n−1])andM= (ΩM,[r0,...,rn−1])be ma-
niplexes such that McoversL. Then there is a group epimorphism µfrom Conn(M)
toConn(L)that mapsritor/prime
ifor alli.
This proposition essentially says that we may think of Conn(M)as acting on the
ﬂags ofL. In particular, Wn=/angbracketlefts0,...,sn−1/angbracketrightacts on the ﬂags of any n-maniplexL,
and we can identify the action of each siwith a generator of Conn(L).
Among all reﬂexible covers of M= (Ω,[r0,...,rn−1])the following cover has
special relevance. Let src(M) := ( Ω,[¯r0,..., ¯rn−1]), where Ω = Conn(M)and for
w∈Ωandi∈{0,...,n−1},¯riw:=riw. (We will describe the reason for the name
“src” in a moment.) Then a covering η:Ω→Ωis deﬁned by specifying some Φ∈Ω
as the image of the identity element id, and then mapping each w∈ΩtowΦ.
The following remark is immediate from the deﬁnition of src(M).
Algebraic Combinatorics , Vol. 5 #2 (2022) 271
Gabe Cunningham, Daniel Pellicer & Gordon Williams
Remark 2.3.For every maniplex Mthere is an isomorphism from Conn(M)to
Conn(src(M))mappingrito¯ri.
Furthermore, the cover src(M)is thesmallest reﬂexible cover ofMin the sense
that any other reﬂexible cover of Mis also a cover of src(M). (A straightforward
adaptation of Proposition 3.16 from [29] can be used to prove this fact.)
Note that the deﬁnition of src(M)is actually a deﬁnition of a covering of rooted
maniplexes and in principle it depends on the image Φofid∈Ω. However, since
src(M)is reﬂexible, diﬀerent choices of such a ﬂag Φyield isomorphic covers, and so
src(M)is a well-deﬁned construction on the category of unrooted maniplexes.
Ifsrc(M)is polytopal then it has been denoted elsewhere as the minimal reg-
ular cover , which is indeed minimal even when restricting only to polytopal covers.
However, the smallest reﬂexible cover of Mmay not be polytopal, even if Mis a poly-
tope. If a polytope Phas a non-polytopal smallest reﬂexible cover then Phas rank
at least 4([29, Proposition 6.1]). To date, relatively few examples of non-polytopal
smallest reﬂexible covers of polytopes are known, which motivates the search for more
such examples.
To conclude this section we state a simple result about the action of the connection
group of src(M)on the ﬂags ofM.
Proposition 2.4.IfR= src(M), then the identity element is the only element in
Conn(R)that ﬁxes every ﬂag of M.
Proof.First, recall that Conn(M)is a concrete permutation group on Ω, the set of
ﬂags ofM. Remark 2.3 says that Conn(R)is isomorphic to Conn(M). It follows that
if an element of Conn(R)ﬁxes every ﬂag of M, then it corresponds to the identity
permutation and thus the identity element of Conn(R). 
3.Stratified operations
If we want to ﬁnd 4-polytopes whose smallest reﬂexible cover is not polytopal, where
do we start? One appealing way is to apply well-known operations to small poly-
topes and analyze the result. Most of the literature so far on the connection group
of polytopes has used this approach, considering truncations of polytopes as well as
pyramids and prisms over polytopes; see [1], [2], [18], [19], [28] and [33]. In [34], two
of the authors analyzed the connection groups of pyramids over the regular toroidal
maps, determining which pyramids have a polytopal smallest reﬂexible cover. What
can we say about pyramids over non-regular equivelar toroidal maps?
We will show that if Mis a maniplex with smallest reﬂexible cover R, then the
smallest reﬂexible cover of the pyramid over Mis the same as the smallest reﬂexible
cover of the pyramid over R. Moreover, it turns out that the properties of the pyra-
mid operation that lead to this result are in fact shared by most common maniplex
operations. Let us start by considering pyramids over polytopes, and then generalize
to other operations.
3.1.Smallest reflexible covers of pyramids. The notion of a pyramid over
ann-polytopePcomes from convex geometry, where it is deﬁned as the ( (n+ 1)-
dimensional)convexhullof P∪{a0},forsomepoint a0outsidetheaﬃnespanof P(see
for example [16]). The point a0is denoted the apex, andPthebaseof the pyramid.

Here we ﬁnd it convenient to deﬁne the pyramid over an arbitrary maniplex as
follows.

Stratiﬁed operations on maniplexes
Definition 3.1.Given ann-maniplexM= (Ω,[r0,...,rn−1]), thepyramid overM

(k−1,Φ)ifk=n−i+ 1,
(k,ri−1Φ)ifk>n−i+ 1.
The elements of the set {0,...,n + 1}are called the layersofPyr(M).
In Deﬁnition 3.1, the base of the pyramid corresponds to the n-face consisting of
the ﬂags (0,Φ)and the apex corresponds to the vertex consisting of the ﬂags (n+1,Φ)
(see Figure 2).
STRATIFIED OPERATIONS ON MANIPLEXES
This concept has been extended to abstract polytopes. In [15] it is a particular instance
of a product of polytopes.
Here we find it convenient to define pyramid over an arbitrary maniplex as follows.
Definition 3.1. Given an n-maniplex M= (Ω,[r0, . . . , r n−1]), the pyramid over M
is the ( n+ 1)-maniplex Pyr(M) = ({0, . . . , n + 1} ×Ω,[s0, . . . , s n]), where
si(k,Φ) =

(k, riΦ) if k < n −i,
(k+ 1,Φ) if k=n−i,
(k−1,Φ) if k=n−i+ 1,
(k, ri−1Φ) if k > n −i+ 1.
The elements of the set {0, . . . , n + 1}are called the layers of Pyr( M).
In Definition 3.1, the base of the pyramid corresponds to the n-face consisting of
the flags (0 ,Φ) and the apex corresponds to the vertex consisting of the flags ( n+1,Φ)
(see Figure 2).

Figure 2. The flags of the pyramid over a square (left) and its base

The motivation of Definition 3.1 is the following. The pyramid Pyr( M) has one
facet isomorphic to M, namely that consisting of the flags whose first coordinate
equals 0. Then, for every facet LofMthere is a facet of Pyr(M) consisting of the
flags ( k,Ψ) with Ψ a flag containing Landk >1. A careful inspection shows that this
facet of Msatisfies the definition to be the pyramid over L(with first coordinates
shifted by 1). The equivalence between Definition 3.1 and the ones in [16] and [15]
(applied to the appropriate class of objects) can be easily shown by induction, with
base given by the triangle (pyramid over a 1-maniplex).
Pyramids are well-behaved maniplexes in several respects. One of them is with

Figure 2. The ﬂags of the pyramid over a square (left) and its base
square (right).
The motivation of Deﬁnition 3.1 is the following. The pyramid Pyr(M)has one
facet isomorphic to M, namely that consisting of the ﬂags whose ﬁrst coordinate
equals 0. Then, for every facet LofMthere is a facet of Pyr(M)consisting of the
ﬂags (k,Ψ)with Ψa ﬂag containingLandk>1. A careful inspection shows that this
facet ofMsatisﬁes the deﬁnition to be the pyramid over L(with ﬁrst coordinates
shifted by 1). The equivalence between Deﬁnition 3.1 and the ones in [16] and [15]
(applied to the appropriate class of objects) can be easily shown by induction, with
base given by the triangle (pyramid over a 1-maniplex).
Pyramids are well-behaved maniplexes in several respects. One of them is with
their interaction with quotients, as shown by the following result.
Lemma3.2.IfMcoversLthen Pyr(M)covers Pyr(L).
Proof.Letπbethecoveringfrom M= (ΩM,[r0,...,rn−1])toL= (ΩL,[r/prime
0,...,r/prime
n−1]).
Then it follows from Deﬁnition 3.1 that the mapping ˜π:{0,...,n + 1}×ΩM→
{0,...,n + 1}×ΩLgiven by (k,Φ)˜π= (k,Φπ)is the desired covering. 
There is also a nice interaction between the layers of the pyramid and the action
of the connection group. Observe that the generator siacts as the transposition
σi:= (n−i,n−i+ 1)on the ﬁrst coordinates of all ﬂags. More generally, if x∈Wn+1
withx=si1···sit, then we will use σxto denoteσi1···σit, so thatxacts on the ﬁrst
coordinates of all ﬂags as σx.

The action on the second coordinate is also independent of the choice of ﬂag Φand
the choice of maniplex. In other words, for each kandi, there is an element wk,i∈Wn
such thatsi(k,Φ) = (σik,wk,iΦ). Indeed, we have:
wk,i=

riifk<n−i,
idifn−i6k6n−i+ 1,
ri−1ifk>n−i+ 1.
We extend this notation recursively as follows. First, we understand wk,sito mean
the same thing as wk,i. Now, ifxis the product of some tgenerators of Wn+1with
t>1, then we may write x=yσi, whereyis the product of t−1generators. Then
we deﬁne
wk,x=wσik,ywk,i,
which makes it so that x(k,Φ) = (σxk,wk,xΦ).
Summarizing, we have shown:
Proposition 3.3.
(1)Wn+1acts on{0,...,n +1}via the homomorphism that sends each sitoσi=
(n−i,n−i+ 1), and where we denote the image of xbyσx. This action does
not depend on the choice of base maniplex.
(2)For everyk∈{0,...,n +1}and everyx∈Wn+1, there is an element wk,x∈
Wnsuch that, for all Φ,
x(k,Φ) = (σxk,wk,xΦ).
Furthermore, wk,xdoes not depend on the choice of base maniplex.
We are now ready for the main theorem of this section.
Theorem 3.4.LetMbe a maniplex and Rbe its smallest reﬂexible cover. Then
Conn(Pyr(M)) = Conn(Pyr(R)).
Proof.We know from Lemma 3.2 that Pyr(R)covers Pyr(M). Then Proposition 2.2
tells us that there is a surjective group homomorphism µ: Conn(Pyr(R))→
Conn(Pyr(M)). It only remains to show that it is in fact an isomorphism.
Letnbe the rank ofR. Consider an element x∈Wn+1such that the image of x
inConn(Pyr(R))is in the kernel of µ. In other words, xﬁxes every ﬂag of Pyr(M),
sox(k,Φ) = (k,Φ)for every ﬂag ΦofMand every layer k. By Proposition 3.3,
xacts on the layers as some permutation σxthat is independent of the choice of
base maniplex. Thus, since xﬁxes every layer of Pyr(M), it also ﬁxes every layer of
Pyr(R). Now, Proposition 3.3 also says that for each k, there is an element wk,xof
Wnsuch thatx(k,Φ) = (k,wk,xΦ)for every Φ. So for each k, the element wk,xﬁxes
every ﬂag ΦofM. By Proposition 2.4, wk,xis trivial and hence Conn(Pyr(M)) =
Conn(Pyr(R)). 
Having shown that the pyramid operation interacts nicely with connection groups,
our attention naturally turns to other constructions. Do prisms over polytopes work
the same way? What about truncations of polyhedra? The essential properties of the
pyramid construction that led to Theorem 3.4 are that:
(1) IfMcoversL, then Pyr(M)covers Pyr(L).
(2) In the deﬁnition of pyramids in Deﬁnition 3.1, each siacts on the layers
independently of the base maniplex, and each siacts on the ﬂags Φin a way
that only depends on iand the layer k.

Stratiﬁed operations on maniplexes
Roughly speaking, the second condition will be satisﬁed by any maniplex operation
whose deﬁnition looks like:
si(k,Φ) =

(k/prime,uΦ)if (some condition on iandk),
···
(k/prime/prime,vΦ)if (some condition on iandk).
Example 3.5.Consider a map ( 3-maniplex)M. Itsmedialis a new map Me (M)with
ﬂags (0,Φ)and(2,Φ)for each ﬂag ΦofM. Then we have:
si(k,Φ) =

(k,r1Φ)ifi= 0,
(k,r2−kΦ)ifi= 1,
(2−k,Φ)ifi= 2.
(See [22].) So the medial operation satisﬁes condition (2) above.
Let us describe condition (2) a little more formally, and then we can see which
other maniplex operations satisfy that condition.
3.2.Stratified operations and connection groups.
Definition 3.6.Consider a maniplex operation F:Mn→Mm. We say that Fis a
stratiﬁed maniplex operation if there is a set A(called the set of strataorlayers)
such that:
(1)IfΩis the set of ﬂags of a maniplex M, then the set of ﬂags of F(M)is
a subset of A×Ωsuch that the canonical projections into AandΩare both
surjective.
(2)LetS={s0,...,sm−1}be the set of generators of Wm; thenWmhas a well-
deﬁned action on A, where we denote by σithe permutation of Ainduced by
si∈S.
(3)There is a function ϕ:A×S→Wnsuch that, for every maniplex Mand
ﬂagΦ, the action of sionA×Ωis described by
si(a,Φ) = (σia,ϕ(a,si)Φ).
Additionally, if the set of ﬂags of F(M)is all ofA×Ω, then we say that Fisfully
stratiﬁed . For brevity, we will typically denote ϕ(a,si)bywa,i, so that
si(a,Φ) = (σia,wa,iΦ).
Proposition 3.7.Suppose that Fis a stratiﬁed maniplex operation, with function
ϕ:A×S→Wnas in Deﬁnition 3.6. Thenϕcan be extended to a function ˜ϕ:
A×Wm→Wnsuch that, for every x∈Wmwe havex(a,Φ) = (σxa,˜ϕ(a,x)Φ). We
will typically denote ˜ϕ(a,x)bywa,x.
Proof.Letx=si1···sit∈Wm. Then
x(a,Φ) = (si1···sit−1)sit(a,Φ)
=si1···sit−1(σita,wa,itΦ).
Continuing in this way, we ﬁnd that x(a,Φ) = (σxa,wa,xΦ)for some permutation σx
ofAand some element wa,x∈Wnthat depends only on aandx. 
Let us oﬀer one cautionary note – if we want to deﬁne a new maniplex operation
by just picking a set Aand a function ϕ, there are several restrictions. For example,
we need
uv(a,Φ) = (σuva,˜ϕ(a,uv)Φ)
Algebraic Combinatorics , Vol. 5 #2 (2022) 275
Gabe Cunningham, Daniel Pellicer & Gordon Williams
and also
uv(a,Φ) =u(σva,˜ϕ(a,v)Φ) = (σuva,˜ϕ(va,u) ˜ϕ(a,v)Φ),
implying that ˜ϕ(a,uv) = ˜ϕ(va,u) ˜ϕ(a,v)for alla,u, andv. It is not so easy to pick ϕ
so that it satisﬁes this unless it does not really depend on a(see Section 3.4). For now,
werestrictourattentiontomerelydescribingwhat ϕisforwell-knownoperationsthat
already exist.
A maniplex operation is cover-preserving if, wheneverMcoversL, thenF(M)
coversF(L). (In fact, in this case usually Fwill deﬁne a functor on the category of
rootedn-maniplexes.) Recall that one of the features of the operation Pyrthat led
to Theorem 3.4 is that Pyris cover-preserving. It turns out that we get that for free
when working with fully stratiﬁed operations.
Proposition 3.8.IfFis a fully stratiﬁed maniplex operation, then Fis cover-
preserving.
Proof.Suppose thatMandLaren-maniplexes such that π:M→L is a covering.
We want to deﬁne a covering ˜π:F(M)→F(L), and the obvious possibility is
(a,Φ)˜π= (a,Φπ). (SinceFis fully stratiﬁed, we can be sure that (a,Φπ)is a ﬂag of
F(L).) To show that this is a covering, it suﬃces to show that ˜πcommutes with the
action ofWm. That is, we want to show that for each j,(sj(a,Φ))˜π=sj((a,Φ)˜π).
We ﬁnd:
(sj(a,Φ))˜π= (σja,ϕ(a,sj)Φ)˜π= (σja,(ϕ(a,sj)Φ)π),
whereas
sj((a,Φ)˜π) =sj(a,Φπ) = (σja,ϕ(a,sj)(Φπ)),
and the two expressions on the right are equal since the action of πcommutes with
the action of connections. 
Now we can prove a generalization of Theorem 3.4.
Theorem 3.9.Suppose that Fis a fully stratiﬁed maniplex operation. Let Mbe a
maniplex with smallest reﬂexible cover R. Then Conn(F(R)) = Conn(F(M)).
Proof.ByProposition3.8, Fiscover-preserving.So F(R)coversF(M),whichimplies
that there is a surjective group homomorphism πfrom Conn(F(R))toConn(F(M))
that sends each generator of the former to the corresponding generator of the latter.
It remains to show that this is an isomorphism.
Suppose that x∈Wmis such that the image of xinConn(F(R))is in the kernel
ofπ. In other words, xﬁxes every ﬂag of F(M). SinceFis fully stratiﬁed, the ﬂags
ofF(M)include all pairs (a,Φ)witha∈AandΦa ﬂag ofM. Then it follows that
σxﬁxes every a∈A. Furthermore, for each a, the element ϕ(a,x)ﬁxes every ﬂag of
M. Then Proposition 2.4 says that ϕ(a,x)ﬁxes every ﬂag of Ras well. Thus we have
shown that for every ﬂag (a,Φ)ofF(R), we havex(a,Φ) = (a,Φ), which implies that
xcorresponds to the identity of Conn(F(R)). Therefore, the map from Conn(F(R))
toConn(F(M))is an isomorphism. 
3.3.Examples of fully stratified operations. In light of Theorem 3.9, it is
worthwhile to know which maniplex operations are fully stratiﬁed. To demonstrate
that an operation Fis fully stratiﬁed, it is enough to do the following.
(1) Show that there is a set Asuch that the ﬂags of F(M)can be identiﬁed with
all pairs (a,Φ)witha∈AandΦa ﬂag ofM.
Algebraic Combinatorics , Vol. 5 #2 (2022) 276
Stratiﬁed operations on maniplexes
(2) Deﬁne the action of each si∈Wmon(a,Φ)in a way that looks like
si(a,Φ) =

(a/prime,uΦ)if (some condition on ianda),
···
(a/prime/prime,vΦ)if (some condition on ianda).
(We can extract the necessary function ϕ:A×S→Wnfrom this deﬁnition.)
Example 3.10.We already remarked (in Example 3.5) that the ﬂags of Me (M)con-
sist of all pairs (0,Φ)and(2,Φ), where Φranges over all ﬂags of M. The deﬁnition of
the action of simeets the requirements above, and so the operation F(M) =Me(M)
is fully stratiﬁed.
Example 3.11.Truncation of a map (as deﬁned in [31, Section 4.2]) is also a fully
stratiﬁed operation.
Example 3.12.SupposeLis ann-polytope, and let F(M) =M/circledottextL, where/circledottextis
one of the products in [15]. Then Fis fully stratiﬁed; see Section 6.1.
Example 3.13.The operations Clkand/tildewiderClkfrom [32] are fully stratiﬁed; see Sec-
tion 6.2.
Example 3.14.Thek-bubble ofP, deﬁned in [20], is a fully stratiﬁed operation; see
Section 6.3.
3.4.Operations defined using parallel products. We would like to identify
other operations Fthat satisfy the conclusion of Theorem 3.9. First, let us note that
ifFis fully stratiﬁed and if MandLare maniplexes such that Conn(M)∼=Conn(L),
then Theorem 3.9 implies that Conn(F(M))∼=Conn(F(L)). In fact, this condition is
equivalent to the conclusion of Theorem 3.9. Thus we make the following deﬁnition.
Definition 3.15.A maniplex operation Fisconnection-preserving if, whenever
Conn(M)∼=Conn(L), then Conn(F(M))∼=Conn(F(L)).
Now, let us suppose that Fis a stratiﬁed operation with set of strata Aand
with function ϕ:A×Wm→Wn. Let us further suppose that there is a group
homomorphism ψ:Wm→Wnsuch that, for every a∈A, we haveϕ(a,x) =ψ(x).
That means that the action of Wmon a ﬂag (a,Φ)ofF(M)may be written as
x(a,Φ) = (σxa,ψ(x)Φ),
so the action of Wmon the second component does not really depend on a. Thus
xjust acts component-wise; we have an action of Wmon the set Aand an action
(mediated by ψ) ofWmon the ﬂags ofM. This is known as the parallel product of
the two actions [38].
Maniplex operations involving parallel products often depend on the choice of a
baseﬂagfortheinputmaniplex M.Inotherwords,theseoperationsaremoreproperly
thought of as operations that take rooted maniplexes as input. The deﬁnition of a
stratiﬁed operation works without modiﬁcation for rooted maniplexes.
Proposition 3.16.Suppose that ψ:Wm→Wnis a surjective group homomorphism,
and thatWmacts transitively on A/negationslash=?via a homomorphism that sends each sito
a permutation σiofA. Leta0be a ﬁxed base point of A. For rooted n-maniplexes
(M,Φ0), deﬁneF(M,Φ0)to be the rooted m-maniplex whose ﬂags are the orbit of
(a0,Φ0)under the action of Wm, where
x(a,Φ) = (σxa,ψ(x)Φ).
ThenFis a cover-preserving, stratiﬁed operation.
Algebraic Combinatorics , Vol. 5 #2 (2022) 277
Gabe Cunningham, Daniel Pellicer & Gordon Williams
Proof.To show that Fis stratiﬁed, the only part that is not immediate is that the
set of ﬂags of F(M)needs to project surjectively onto AandΩ. This is true because
Wmacts transitively on A, and because ψis surjective and Wnacts transitively on Ω.
Now, we want to show that Fis cover-preserving. Suppose that (M,Φ0)and
(L,Ψ0)are rooted n-maniplexes such that π:M→L is a covering that sends Φ0
toΨ0. As in Proposition 3.8, we deﬁne ˜π:F(M)→F(L)by(a,Φ)˜π= (a,Φπ).
In order for this to be well-deﬁned, we need to show that (a,Φπ)is a ﬂag of F(L)
whenever (a,Φ)is a ﬂag of F(M). By deﬁnition, the ﬂags of F(M)consist of the
orbit of (a0,Φ0)under the action of Wm. So for each (a,Φ), there is some x∈Wm
such that (a,Φ) =x(a0,Φ0) = (σxa0,ψ(x)Φ0). Then:
x(a0,Ψ0) = (σxa0,ψ(x)Ψ0)
= (a,ψ(x)(Φ0π))
= (a,(ψ(x)Φ0)π)
= (a,Φπ),
and so (a,Φπ)is in the orbit of (a0,Ψ0)and thus a ﬂag of F(L). The rest of the
proof (showing that ˜πcommutes with connections) is the same as the proof of
Proposition 3.8. 
Definition 3.17.A maniplex operation Fisa parallel product if it satisﬁes the
conditions of Proposition 3.16.
Let us look at several examples of parallel products.
Example 3.18.TheI-doubles of a map (deﬁned in [26]) can be seen as a parallel
product, where Ais a two element set with some prescribed action of Wm, and where
Wmacts in the natural way on Ω.
Example 3.19.LetLbe ann-maniplex with base ﬂag Ψ0. Consider the operation
on rootedn-maniplexes deﬁned by F(M,Φ0) = (M,Φ0)/diamondmath(L,Ψ0). This is the mix
of rooted maniplexes, as deﬁned in [8, Section 3.2] and seen in other forms in many
previous papers. The ﬂags of F(M,Φ0)consist of (some) pairs (Φ,Ψ), with Φa ﬂag
ofMandΨa ﬂag ofL, and for each i,si(Φ,Ψ) = (riΦ,riΨ). (In fact, in this case
we havem=n, so maybe we ought to write ri(Φ,Ψ) = (riΦ,riΨ).)
Example 3.20.LetQbe a vertex-bipartite polytope, and consider the operation on
facet-bipartite polytopes Pgiven byF(P) =P|Q, theﬂat amalgamation of Pand
Q. (See [6, Deﬁnition 4.2].) This is also a parallel product.
Now let us show that parallel products are connection-preserving.
Theorem 3.21.Suppose that Fis a parallel product. Let Mbe a maniplex with small-
est reﬂexible cover R. Then Conn(F(R)) = Conn(F(M)).
Proof.By Proposition 3.16, Fis cover-preserving. So F(R)coversF(M), which
implies that there is a surjective group homomorphism πfrom Conn(F(R))to
Conn(F(M))that sends each generator of the former to the corresponding generator
of the latter. It remains to show that this is an isomorphism.
Suppose that x∈Wmsuch that the image of xinConn(F(R))is in the kernel of π.
Inotherwords, xﬁxeseveryﬂagof F(M).SinceFisstratiﬁed,every a∈Aappearsas
part of a ﬂag (a,Φ)ofF(M). Thenxmust ﬁx every a∈A. Now, every ﬂag Φappears
as part of a ﬂag (a,Φ), and so for every Φthere is some asuch thatϕ(a,x)ﬁxes Φ.
SinceFis a parallel product, there is a function ψsuch thatϕ(a,x) =ψ(x). So, for
every Φwe have that ψ(x)ﬁxes Φ. By Proposition 2.4, it follows that ψ(x)ﬁxes every
ﬂag ofRas well. Thus we have shown that for every ﬂag (Φ,a)ofF(R), we have
Algebraic Combinatorics , Vol. 5 #2 (2022) 278
Stratiﬁed operations on maniplexes
x(a,Φ) = (a,Φ), which implies that xcorresponds to the identity of Conn(F(R)).
Therefore, the map from Conn(F(R))toConn(F(M))is an isomorphism. 
3.5.Open problems on stratified and non-stratified operations. Let us
look at an example of a stratiﬁed operation that is neither fully stratiﬁed nor a
parallel product.
Example 3.22.Consider the operation F(M) =Tw(M), the general twist of [10]. We
can takeA={0,1}(or to be the colors “red” and “white”), and the ﬂags of F(M)
consist of pairs (c,Φ)wherecis the color of Φ. Then the deﬁnition of the action of
eachsiis given in Section 4.3 of [10], and each siswaps colors. Also, Fis stratiﬁed,
but neither fully stratiﬁed nor a parallel product.
Wenaturallywonderwhether Twisconnection-preserving.Asimpleexampleshows
that it need not be.
Proposition 3.23.There is a twist operator Twthat is not connection-preserving.
Proof.LetMbeKrughoﬀ’s cube (see [10, Section 4.1]). There is a twist opera-
torTwsuch thatTw(M)is reﬂexible (the trivial extension of a cube). Both M
andTw(M)have 96ﬂags. Since Tw(M)is reﬂexible,|Conn(Tw(M))|= 96. On the
other hand,Mis not reﬂexible, so src(M)has more ﬂags than M. It follows that
|Conn(Tw(src(M)))|>|Conn(Tw(M))|. 
Problem 3.24.Describe the necessary conditions for a stratiﬁed operation to be
connection-preserving.
With such a wide-ranging list of stratiﬁed operations, we start to wonder which
operations are notstratiﬁed. The following result helps us demonstrate that some
operations are not stratiﬁed. Let |M|denote the number of ﬂags of a maniplex M.
Proposition 3.25.Suppose that Fis a maniplex operation such that, if Mis ﬁnite,
thenF(M)is ﬁnite. Furthermore, suppose that |F(M)|/|M|is an unbounded function
ofMfor ﬁnite maniplexes. Then Fis not stratiﬁed.
Proof.SupposeFis stratiﬁed and that Mis ﬁnite. Then since the projection from the
ﬂag set ofF(M)toAis surjective, and F(M)is ﬁnite whenMis ﬁnite, this implies
thatAis ﬁnite. On the other hand, |F(M)|6|M|·|A|, and so|F(M)|/|M|6|A|,
and so|F(M)|/|M|is bounded. 
Example 3.26.Consider the operation F(M) = 2M, ﬁrst introduced in [9] for inci-
dence complexes, and adapted in its dual form for maniplexes in [10]. Then Fis not
stratiﬁed – it yields |F(M)|/|M|= 2v, wherevis the number of vertices of M, and
this is unbounded.
Problem 3.27.Other than Proposition 3.25, what other conditions guarantee that an
operationFis not stratiﬁed?
Problem 3.28.Even though 2Mis not stratiﬁed, is it connection-preserving?
4.Pyramids over equivelar toroidal maps
In this section we use the results of Section 3 to classify the smallest reﬂexible covers
of the pyramids over the equivelar toroidal maps. To do this we will make use of the
classiﬁcations of the symmetry types of equivelar toroidal maps in Theorems 7 and
8 of [23] (see also [3]), the classiﬁcation of the minimal regular covers of equivelar
toroidal maps obtained by Drach and Mixer in [11], and the classiﬁcation of the
minimal regular covers of the pyramids over the regular toroidal maps in [34] obtained
by Pellicer and Williams.

4.1.Connection Groups of Pyramids Over Regular Toroidal Maps. First,
we brieﬂy summarize the main results from Pellicer and Williams’ [34].
The main technique of that paper was to represent the connection group of a
polytope as (isomorphic to) a subgroup of the wreath product of Aut(P)withSk,
wherekis the number of ﬂag orbits of P, i.e. as a subgroup of ∆ :=Sk≀[k]Aut(P) =
SknAut(P)k. To do this, we deﬁne an injective map ι: Conn(P)/arrowhookleft→∆as follows.
LetGbe the symmetry type graph of P(see [7]) with ﬂag graph FG(P), andTa
spanning tree of G. The lifts of TtoFG(P)arechunks; each ﬂag lies in precisely
one chunk, and each chunk contains exactly one ﬂag from each orbit OiofΩunder
the action of Aut(P), and consequently the chunks form a partition on the ﬂags of
P. Let Φ1be a representative of orbit O1, and let Φi∈Oibe the representatives of
the remaining orbits in the chunk containing Φ1. Letω∈Conn(P). Then for each i
there is a unique element αi∈Aut(P)taking Φ1to the representative of O1in the
chunk containing Φω
i, and an element σ∈Skcorresponding to the permutation on
the indices of the orbits induced by ω. We thus deﬁne ι: Conn(P)→∆by
ι(ω) := (σ,[α1,α2,...,αk]).
This map is an injective homomorphism ([34, Prop. 4.3]) and thus |Conn(P)|6
|Aut(P)|k·k!([34,Lemma4.4]).Wesummarizetheseresultswiththefollowinglemma.
Lemma 4.1.LetPbe a polytope with automorphism group Aut(P), and letkbe the
number of orbits in F(P)under the action of Aut(P). Then Conn(P)is isomorphic
to a subgroup of Sk≀[k]Aut(P).
The pyramid operation is a fully stratiﬁed operation on a regular polytope Pof
rankn(here viewed as a rooted maniplex), wherein the indexing set for the orbits
in the automorphism group of the pyramid over Pcorrespond to the strata (but
are shifted by 1 from Section 3.1 due to the diﬀerences between the indexing sets;
those used in [34] reﬂected the standard notation for Sk). This is actually quite nice,
because in general the set of strata need not correspond to orbits. For example, the
prism operation over regular n-polytopes is stratiﬁed, and there are 2n+ 2strata
formed by the construction, but at most n+ 1orbits. In the context of the pyramids
over the equivelar toroidal maps, the pyramiding operation is a stratiﬁed operation
on 3-maniplexes that produces a 4-maniplex. Following Deﬁnition 3.6, we thus have
k= 5strata. IfSisthesetofgeneratorsof W4,thentheaction σiofsionAistheﬁrst
component of ι(si). IfΦis in orbita, thenφ(a,si)is the (induced) left action of αa
on a ﬂag (1,Φ)∼Φ1described above. In other words, it is the a-th component of the
second component of ι(si). Here we are taking strong advantage of the identiﬁcation
of the automorphism group of the regular toroidal base with its connection group.
4.2.The Regular Covers of the Equivelar Toroidal Maps. In [23] a clas-
siﬁcation of the equivelar toroidal maps is described. All such maps are quotients of
the regular Euclidean tessellations {4,4},{3,6}and{6,3}. Since the last two families
are dual to each other, it suﬃces to conﬁne our discussion to the classiﬁcation of the
equivelar toroidal maps of Schläﬂi type {4,4}and{3,6}. Classes of toroidal maps
are organized according to the number of orbits k, and by two translation vectors
that generate the translation subgroup of the corresponding universal regular poly-
tope needed to form the equivelar toroidal map as its quotient. (But note that there
are many equivalent choices for generating a particular translation subgroup.) The
two-orbit equivelar toroidal maps are further classiﬁed according to which adjacent

classiﬁcation of equivelar toroidal maps of type {3,6}requires only the number of
orbits and the two translation vectors.
For the{4,4}equivelar toroidal maps, it is convenient to start with a regular
tessellation of type {4,4}whose vertices correspond to the Gaussian integer lattice
in the complex plane given by Z[i] ={a+bi:a,b∈Z}. Thus vectors corresponding
to translational symmetries of the tiling may be written as elements of Z[i], and any
subgroup of translational symmetries will be determined by two linearly independent
vectors (a,b)and(c,d), which in turn can be represented by the Gaussian integers
α=a+biandβ=c+di, respectively. Every equivelar toroidal map of type {4,4}is
a quotient of{4,4}by such a translational subgroup.
The{3,6}equivelar toroidal maps may be described similarly, this time by as-
sociating the vertices of the tiling {3,6}with the Eisenstein integers Z[ω]whereω
is the sixth root(1)of unity1+i√
3
2. We may associate to each proper translational
subgroup of the symmetries of {3,6}a pair of linearly independent vectors with (a,b)
and(c,d)relative to the basis (1,0),(1
2,√
3
2). We may then encode these vectors as
Eisenstein integers α=a+bωandβ=c+dωfor ease in computing minimal regular
covers, noting that ω2=ω−1. Every equivelar tiling of Schläﬂi type {3,6}arises as
a quotient by such a translational subgroup of the regular polytope {3,6}.
Throughout what follows, σis eitheriorωas appropriate. Following [11], we deﬁne
N(α) =αα, wherea+bσis deﬁned to be a+bσwithσthe usual complex conjugate
ofσ. In particular, N(1 +i) = 2andN(1 +ω) = 3.
Traditionally (cf. [27, 37]) the regular toroidal maps are written as {p,q}(n,0)or
{p,q}(n,n), wheren∈Z, with the subscript (n,0)indicating that the translational
subgroup is generated by (n,0)and(0,n), and the subscript (n,n)indicated that the
translational subgroup is generated by (n,n)and(−n,n)in the{4,4}case and (n,n)
and(−n,2n)in the{3,6}case (written with respect to the basis of the lattice). If
we letTbe our regular tiling of the plane of type {3,6}or{4,4}, then mimicking
the classical notation for these toroidal maps we may write Tηto denote a regular
toroidal map where η=norη=n+nσas appropriate.
In [11], using factorization properties of the Gaussian and Eisenstein integers, it
was shown that the minimal regular cover of an equivelar tiling is easily determined
from the following result.
Theorem 4.2 ([11, Theorem 3.6]) .LetTα,βbe an equivelar toroidal map represented
as a quotient of a regular planar tessellation Tby a translation subgroup /angbracketleftα,β/angbracketrightof
the translational symmetry subgroup of Tgenerated by two non-collinear vectors,
corresponding to the complex numbers α,β∈Z[σ]withα=a+bσ,β =c+dσ.
Letg= GCD(a,b,c,d ). Then forTα,βthere exists a unique minimal regular covering

the same and here we are following the treatment in [11] and [23].

4.3.Connection groups of pyramids over equivelar toroidal maps. In[34]
the connection groups of pyramids over the regular toroidal maps were classiﬁed, and
in particular, it was shown that the connection groups of all pyramids over regular
toroidal maps of type {3,6}and{6,3}are string C-groups [34, Prop. 6.10], as are
the connection groups of pyramids over toroidal maps of type {4,4}, except for the
pyramids over toroidal maps of type {4,4}(n,0)withnodd [34, Prop. 6.2-6.4]. In
summary,
Theorem 4.3.The smallest reﬂexible cover of the pyramid over a regular toroidal
map is a regular polytope except when the map is of type {4,4}(n,0)withnodd.
Algebraic Combinatorics , Vol. 5 #2 (2022) 282
Stratiﬁed operations on maniplexes
Consequently, by Theorem 3.4, it is easy to see that the pyramid over an equivelar
toroidal map has a polytopal minimal regular cover except when the underlying map
is of type{4,4}(n,0)withnodd.
Example 4.4.Consider the 2-orbit equivelar toroidal maps {4,4}(6,10),(10,6)and
{4,4}(4,5),(5,4)of type 21. In the former case the GCD of the coeﬃcients is g= 2, and
a= 6,b= 10. Hencea
g= 3≡1 (mod 2) andb
g= 5≡1 (mod 2) , and so the smallest
reﬂexible cover is the polytopal minimal regular cover of Pyr({4,4}(16,16)), which has
256·3·5ﬂags. In the latter case, the GCD of the coeﬃcients is 1, so the smallest
reﬂexible cover of Pyr({4,4}(4,5),(5,4))is the maniplex corresponding to the smallest
reﬂexible cover of Pyr({4,4}(9,0)), which has 212·321·5ﬂags, and is not a polytope.
5.Concluding remarks
Section 4 shows one way to use Theorem 3.9; namely, if we want to know something
about Conn(F(M)), then we can work with Conn(F(R))instead, whereR= src(M).
Since the theory of reﬂexible maniplexes is much more well-developed than the theory
of non-reﬂexible maniplexes, it is often easier to deal with Conn(F(R)), and working
this way is especially appealing for classes of maniplexes where the smallest reﬂexible
covers are well-understood.
There are also good reasons to use Theorem 3.9 in reverse. That is, suppose we
would like to know something about Conn(F(R))whereRis reﬂexible, and suppose
we know thatMis a maniplex with smallest reﬂexible cover R. For computational
experimentation, working with the smaller maniplex Mwill usually be faster.
For example, let us consider the prisms over the regular toroidal maps {4,4}(n,0).
Using some GAP [13] code written by the ﬁrst author, we calculated the connection
group of the prism over {4,4}(n,0)forn630and determined that all such groups
were string C-groups. This calculation took about 160 seconds on the ﬁrst author’s
computer. Now, since {4,4}(n,0)is the smallest reﬂexible cover of {4,4}(n,0),(0,1)(that
is, the quotient of the regular tessellation of type {4,4}by the group generated by the
translations by vectors (n,0)and(0,1)), we can also determine the connection group
of the prisms over the latter. For n630, we again determined that all such groups
were string C-groups; this time the calculation took about 3 seconds. In fact, in about
32 seconds we were able to cover n6100using the second method. The source code
for computing the connection groups of toroidal maps as well as pyramids and prisms
over them can be found at http://www.gabrielcunningham.com/connection.gap .
6.Appendix
6.1.Products of polytopes. Four diﬀerent products of polytopes were deﬁned
in [15]. Here we will consider the join product and show that we can use it to deﬁne
a stratiﬁed operation. The other products also deﬁne stratiﬁed operations, and the
proofs are analogous.
The join product of an n-polytopePwith anm-polytopeQis an (m+n+ 1)-
polytope, denoted P1Q. Section 6 of [15] describes the ﬂags as triples (Φ,Ψ,a), where
Φis a ﬂag ofP,Ψis a ﬂag ofQ, anda= (a0,a1,...,am+n+1)is a tuple of elements
from{1,2}such that 2appearsm+ 1times. This determines the faces of a ﬂag as
follows.Foranyﬂag ∆,let∆(i)denotethei-faceof ∆.Considertheﬂag Λ = (Φ,Ψ,a).

Then:
Λ(−1) = (Φ(−1),Ψ(−1)).
Λ(0) =/braceleftBigg
(Φ(0),Ψ(−1))ifa0= 1,
(Φ(−1),Ψ(0))ifa0= 2.
In general, in order to determine Λ(i+ 1), we take Λ(i)(which will look like
(Φ(j),Ψ(k))for somejandk), and ifai+1= 1, we increment j; otherwise we
incrementk.
For the join product of two polytopes, rather than using tuples a, we may as well
just record the position of every 2inainto a subset Iof{0,...,m +n+ 1}. So every
ﬂag ofP1Qcan be represented as a triple Λ = (Φ,Ψ,I), whereI⊂{0,...,n +m+1}
with|I|=m+ 1, and then
Λ(j) = (Φ(j−|I∩{0,...,j}|),Ψ(−1 +|I∩{0,...,j}|)).
Conversely, every triple of this type determines a ﬂag.
Now let us determine the ﬂag that is j-adjacent to a given Λ = (Φ,Ψ,I). First,
suppose that j∈Iandj+ 1/negationslash∈I. Then if we compare Λ(j−1)toΛ(j+ 1), we
see that Λ(j+ 1)has both components diﬀerent from Λ(j−1). Then the section
Λ(j+ 1)/Λ(j−1)of thej-adjacent ﬂag to Λmust just increase the two components
in the opposite order compared to Λ, and so it has j+ 1∈Iinstead ofj∈I. Thus,
if exactly one of jandj+ 1is inI, we have that Λj= (Φ,Ψ,I/triangle{j,j+ 1})(where
I/triangle{j,j+ 1}denotes the symmetric diﬀerence of those two sets).
If bothjandj+ 1are inI, then in moving from Λ(j−1)toΛ(j+ 1), we increase
the second component twice, and so the ﬁrst component remains the same. This
implies that Λjhas the same subset Iand the same ﬂag Φ. For some k, the second
component of Λ(j−1)isΨ(k−1), the second component of Λ(j)isΨ(k), and the
second component of Λ(j+ 1)isΨ(k+ 1). Then the only other ﬂag that diﬀers
from Λonly in its j-face must use Ψkin place of Ψ. In fact, as described above,
k=−1 +|I∩{0,...,j}|, and so
Λj= (Φ,Ψ−1+|I∩{0,...,j}|,I).
A similar argument shows that if neither jnorj+ 1is inI, then
Λj= (Φj−|I∩{0,...,j}|,Ψ,I).
Putting it all together, we get:
sj(Φ,Ψ,I) =

(rj−|I∩{0,...,j}|Φ,Ψ,I),ifj,j+ 1/negationslash∈I,
(Φ,Ψ,I/triangle{j,j+ 1}),if|I∩{j,j+ 1}|= 1,
(Φ,r−1+|I∩{0,...,j}|Ψ,I),ifj,j+ 1∈I.
Now, supposeQis anm-polytope and deﬁne an operation Fonn-polytopesFby
F(P) =P1Q. We can see Fas a fully stratiﬁed operation by taking Ato be all pairs
(Ψ,I).
We have shown:

then the operation Fdeﬁned byF(P) =P/circledottextQis fully stratiﬁed.
6.2.Cleaved polytopes. Given ann-polytopeP, itsk-th cleaved polytope and its
partiallyk-th cleaved polytope were deﬁned in [32]. They consist of
Clk(P) :={F−1}∪{ (F,G) :F6G; rank(F)6k−1; rank(G)>k}

/tildewiderClk(P) :={F−1,Fn−1}∪{(F,G) :F6G; 06rank(F)6k−1;k6rank(G)6n−1},
respectively, where F−1is less than all other faces, Fn−1is greater than all other faces
of/tildewiderClk(P), and in both polytopes (F,G)6(F/prime,G/prime)if and only if F/prime6F6G6G/prime

Theorem 6.2.Clkis fully stratiﬁed.
Proof.According to [32, Remark 5], the set Arequired is the set of vectors with k
entries “−” andn−kentries “ +”.
Given a vector ¯a:= (a1,...,an)withai∈{+,−}, let ¯ai,j:= (a/prime
1,...,a/prime
n)be the
vector in{+,−}nwithak=a/prime
kif and only if k /∈{i,j}. Furthermore, for j>2let
[−](¯a,j)and[+](¯a,j)denote the number of entries “ −” and the number of entries
“+” in{a1,...,aj−1}, respectively. Clearly, [−](¯a,j) + [+](¯a,j) =j−1. Then
s0(¯a,Φ) =/braceleftBigg

Theorem 6.3./tildewiderClkis fully stratiﬁed.
Proof.Same as in the previous theorem, except that:
•¯ais a vector with only n−2entries,k−1of which are “−” and the remaining

6.3.k-bubble of a polytope. Thek-bubble ofP, denoted [P]k, can be viewed as
a generalization of vertex truncation (in a diﬀerent way from cleaved polytopes). As
a poset, [P]kis deﬁned as follows. (See Def. 2.1 and Lemma 2.6 from [20].)
Definition 6.5.We deﬁne a ranked poset [P]kof the same rank as Player by layer.
(1)For06i6k−1, the set of i-faces of [P]kis the same as the set of i-faces
ofP.

(F,G)of ak-face and an incident (i+ 1)-face.
We then adjoin a minimal and maximal element.

(4)(F,G)6Hif and only if G6H.
Theorem 6.6.The operation that takes Pto[P]kis fully stratiﬁed.
Proof.Lemma 2.8 of [20] gives a description of the ﬂags of [P]k. Every ﬂag has the
form
(F−1,F0,...,Fk−1,(Fk,Fk+1),..., (Fk,Fi),Fi,...,Fn),
where (F−1,...,Fn)is a ﬂag ofPandk+ 16i6n. Thus, we may specify a ﬂag of
[P]kas(i,Φ), and all such pairs deﬁne a ﬂag of [P]k.
From this, it is straightforward to prove that:
sj(i,Φ) =

(i,rjΦ)if06j6k−1orj>i+ 1,
(i,rj+1Φ)ifk6j6i−2,
(i−1,Φ)ifj=i−1,
(i+ 1,Φ)ifj=i,
showing that the operation is fully stratiﬁed. 
