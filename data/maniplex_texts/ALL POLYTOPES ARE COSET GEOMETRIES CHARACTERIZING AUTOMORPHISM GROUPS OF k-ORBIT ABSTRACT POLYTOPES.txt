Abstract. Abstract polytopes generalize the classical notion of convex polytopes to more gen-
eral combinatorial structures. The most studied ones are regular and chiral polytopes, as it is
well-known, they can be constructed as coset geometries from their automorphism groups. This is
also known to be true for 2- and 3- orbit 3-polytopes. In this paper we show that every abstract
n-polytope can be constructed as a coset geometry. This construction is done by giving a char-
acterization, in terms of generators, relations and intersection conditions, of the automorphism
group of a k-orbit polytope with given symmetry type graph. Furthermore, we use these results
to show that for all k/negationslash= 2, there exist k-orbitn-polytopes with Boolean automorphism groups ,
for alln≥3.
1.Introduction
In the 1970s several ideas extended the geometric study of convex polytopes to generalize them
from diﬀerent points of view: while Tits studied incidence systems, Coxeter focused on tessellations
of manifolds and Grünbaum proposed to move away from spherical tiles. In the early 1980s Danzer
and Schulte put several of these ideas together to start the study of incidence polytopes , now called
abstract polytopes . An abstract polytope is a ranked, partially ordered set which generalizes the
face lattice of convex polytopes and tessellations. Thus, abstract polytopes generalize the classical
notion of convex polytopes and tessellations to more general combinatorial structures.
The degree of symmetry of an abstract polytope is measured by counting the number of ﬂag
orbits under the action of its automorphism group, where a ﬂag is a maximal chain of the partial
order. Abstractpolytopescanthenbeclassiﬁedintermsoftheirso-calledsymmetrytypegraph([2]),

Polytopes with only one ﬂag-orbit are called regularand are the most studied ones. Regular poly-
topes have maximal degree of symmetry and in particular their automorphism groups are generated
by involutions, often called “(abstract) reﬂections”. The book Abstract Regular Polytopes [11] by

McMullen and Schulte is the standard reference and it is devoted exclusively to the study of abstract
regular polytopes. There are 2n−1classes of n-polytopes with 2 ﬂag orbits, each of them corre-
sponding to one symmetry type graph. Among them is the class of chiralpolytopes ([14]), which
have no “reﬂectional” symmetry, but have maximal “rotational” one.
The study of coset geometries goes back to Tits ([15]). The ideas behind this concept are to
construct incidence structures using groups, and in particular were developed by Tits in connection
to Coxeter groups. It is well-known that regular and chiral polytopes, as well as two-orbit polyhedra
can be seen as coset geometries (see [3],[7] and [14]); this characterization of their automorphism
groups constitute the most important tool to study them. In a recent paper ([8]), the authors showed
that 3-orbit polyhedra, as well, can be seen as coset geometries, and this fact is used to construct
3-orbit polyhedra from symmetric groups.
The purpose of this paper is to prove the following theorem.
Main Theorem. Every abstract polytope can be constructed as a coset geometry.
To show this, we characterize the automorphism group of an abstract polytope with a given
symmetry type graph, in terms of generators and relations, as well as some intersection conditions
on some subgroups and cosets.
Throughout the paper, we work with the ﬂag graph of a polytope, as opposed to the partial order.
In fact, we shall often work with maniplexes , that is, colored graphs that generalize ﬂag graphs of
polytopes ([16]).
As pointed out before, symmetry type graphs are a great tool to classify polytopes (and mani-
plexes) in terms of their automorphism groups. We will rely on them heavily in our study. There
are some (necessary) conditions a graph must satisfy to be the symmetry type graph of a maniplex
or polytope. Graphs satisfying such conditions are called premaniplexes (or admissible graphs) and
will be properly deﬁned in Section 2.1. We believe our main theorem will shed light to the study
ofk-orbit polytopes; in particular, it opens the gate to study one of the main problems in the area
(listed as Problem 12 in [1]):
Question 1. Given a premaniplex, does it exist a polytope (or maniplex) having such premaniplex
as its symmetry type graph?
The problem of ﬁnding polytopes or maniplexes with a given symmetry type graph is in general
very diﬃcult, as one can note, for example, by looking at the history of chiral polytopes: although
it was back in 1991 [14], when Schulte and Weiss studied chiral polytopes and classiﬁed their auto-
morphism groups in terms of generators and relations, it took almost 20years to have a construction
showing that such polytopes existed for all ranks n>3(see [12]).
Very little is know about other particular instances of Question 1. It is known [2] that every
premaniplex with 3 vertices with rank n≥3is the symmetry type graph of a polytope, and in [13]
Pellicer, Potočnik and Toledo proved that every premaniplex of rank n≥3with 2 vertices is the
symmetry type graph of a maniplex, but it is not known if the constructed maniplexes are polytopal
(i.e. the ﬂag graph of a polytope).
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give the basic concepts from the theory of
abstract polytopes as well as maniplexes, and formally introduce the concepts of symmetry type
graphs and premaniplexes. We also state a relaxed version of Question 1, that we answer later, in
Section 4.1. We start Section 3 by going over the main tool used in this paper: voltage graphs.
Then, by using them, in Section 3.1 we construct a maniplex Mfrom a premaniplex Xand a group
G(satisfying some conditions). Then Gwill act onMas a group of automorphisms and the quotient
ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES 3
ofMby the action of Gwill beX. This means that Mwill have symmetry type graph Xif and
only if every automorphism of Mis represented by the action of an element of G.
In Section 4.1, we use the construction of Section 3, as well as the results from [4], to characterize
in terms of generators and relations the groups that are automorphism groups of a polytope with
a given symmetry type graph. We do so by showing that automorphism groups of polytopes must
satisfy certain “intersection conditions” for some subgroups and cosets, that depend on the symmetry
type graph. In other words, we give an algebraic test for the group Gof Section 3.1 that tells us if
the constructed maniplex Mis polytopal or not, thus translating the problem of ﬁnding polytopes
with a given symmetry type graph to a group-theoretic one. This gives an answer to Problem 1 of
[1]. In Section 4.2 we give the proof to the Main Theorem by constructing a polytope as a coset
geometry from a voltage group. This gives an answer to Problem 2 of [1].
We ﬁnish the paper in Section 5 by using the above result to construct k-orbitn-polytopes with
Boolean automorphism groups, (that is, elementary Abelian 2-groups), for all k,n≥3. For this, we
deﬁnecaterpillars as premaniplexes having exactly one generating tree, and study their coverings in
order to avoid the possible extra symmetry that might happen when one uses our construction to
obtain polytopes from groups.
2.Abstract polytopes and maniplexes
In this section we shall give the basic deﬁnitions and properties of abstract polytopes and ma-
niplexes, and some relations between them. For more details, we refer the reader to [4], [11] and
[16].
A partially ordered set is said to be ﬂaggedif it has a (unique) least and a (unique) greatest
element and each maximal chain, called a ﬂag, has the same ﬁnite cardinality. As all ﬂags have
the same cardinality, say n+ 2, ﬂagged posets naturally admit an order-preserving function, the
rank function , from the poset to the set {−1,0,1,...,n}. The rank function allows us to talk about
ﬂag-adjacencies: given two ﬂags ΦandΨof a ﬂagged poset, they are said to be i-adjacent if they
to diﬀer only in the element of rank i.
An(abstract)n-polytope (also called an (abstract) polytope of rank n) is a ﬂagged poset Pin
which the following conditions hold:
•Diamond condition: for each ﬂag ΦofPand eachi∈{0,1,...,n−1}, there exists a unique
i-adjacent ﬂag to Φ.
•Strong ﬂag connectedness: for any two ﬂags ΦandΨofP, there exists a sequence of adjacent
ﬂags connecting ΦtoΨ, such that all the ﬂags in the sequence contain Φ∩Ψas a subset.
The elements of a polytope are called faces, and faces of rank iare calledi-faces. Given a ﬂag Φ,
we often denote its i-face as Φi, and by Φiits (unique!) i-adjacent ﬂag. Recursively, if wis a word
on{0,...,n−1}we denote by Φwithe ﬂag (Φw)i. It is straightforward to see that (Φi)i= Φ, and
that (Φi)j= Φjif and only if i/negationslash=j.
Given a ﬂagged poset Pone can deﬁne its ﬂag graph as the graphG(P)whose vertices are the
ﬂags ofPand two ﬂags ΦandΨare connected by an edge of color i∈{0,1,...,n−1}if and
only if they are i-adjacent. The ﬂag graph of an n-polytope is an n-maniplex , that is, an n-regular
connected simple graph with a proper edge coloring with colors {0,...,n−1}such that if iandj
are two colors satisfying that |i−j|>1, then the graph induced by edges of colors iandjis a
disjoint union of 4-cycles. However, not every maniplex is the ﬂag graph of a polytope.
While abstract polytopes generalize classical polytopes to combinatorial structures, maniplexes
(introduced by Steve Wilson in 2012 [16]) generalize ﬂag graphs of a polytope as well as of the ﬂag
4 ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES
graphs of maps on surfaces (that is, 2-cellular embeddings of connected graphs on surfaces). In order
to unify our notation of abstract polytopes and maniplexes, when dealing with maniplexes we shall
call its vertices ﬂags, and say that two of ﬂags are i-adjacent if they are the vertices of an edge of
colori.
It follows from the deﬁnition of a maniplex that each ﬂag is incident to exactly one edge of each
color. Then, for each i∈{0,1,...,n−1}one can deﬁne rias the permutation of the set of ﬂags that
maps each ﬂag to its i-adjacent one. In other words Φri= Ψif and only if ΦandΨarei-adjacent.
The permutations ri, withi∈{0,1,...,n−1}, are all involutions with no ﬁxed points and, by
connectivity, they generate a group of permutations on the ﬂags which acts transitively on them.
Furthermore, if|i−j|>1thenrirjis also an involution with no ﬁxed points; thus, riandrj
commute.
Since Φriis the ﬂagi-adjacent to Φ, it is convenient to denote it by Φiand to follow the same
recursive notation as before: Φwi= (Φw)iwherewis a word on{0,1,...,n−1}.
The group/angbracketleftr0,r1...,rn−1/angbracketrightis called the monodromy orconnection group of the maniplex M, it
shall be denoted by Mon (M)and we shall call each of its elements a monodromy . Ifwis a word
on the alphabet {0,1,...,n−1}we identify wwith the monodromy x/mapsto→xw, that is, the word
a1a2...akis identiﬁed with the monodromy ra1ra2...rak.
Amaniplex homomorphism is a graph homomorphism that preserves the color of the edges. Using
the connectedness of maniplexes one can see that every maniplex homomorphism is determined by
the image of one ﬂag and that they are all surjective. The notions of isomorphism andautomorphism
follow naturally.
As with polytopes, we denote the automorphism group of a maniplex MbyΓ(M). By deﬁnition,
ifγ∈Γ(M), then (Φri)γ= (Φi)γ= (Φγ)i= (Φγ)ri, for alli∈{0,1,...,n−1}, implying that
ωγ=γωfor allω∈Mon (M).
Note further that, since the action of Mon (M)is transitive, the action of Γ(M)is free (or
semi-regular). Of course, this is true for both polytopes and maniplexes.
LetMbe ann-maniplex. If I⊂{0,1,...,n−1}, we deﬁneMIas the subgraph of Minduced by
the edges of colors in I. Ifi∈{0,1,...,n−1}, we use the symbol ito denote the set {0,1,...,n−
1}\{i}, and more generally, if K⊂{0,1,...,n−1}, we denote its complement by K. In particular
Miis the subgraph of Mobtained by removing the edges of color i. We will use this notation also
for any graph with a coloring of its edges even if it is not a maniplex.
In [4] Garza-Vargas and Hubard describe how to recover a polytope Pfrom its ﬂag graph: the
elements of rank iofPare the connected components of Mi; the order is given as follows: given
connected components FandGofMiandMj, respectively, we set F <Gif and only if i<jand
F∩G/negationslash=∅.
Moreover, starting with Mone can construct the set of i-faces as the connected components of
Miand deﬁne the relation F <GforF∈MiandG∈Mjif and only if i<jandF∩G/negationslash=∅. The
set of alli-faces, with i∈{0,...,n−1}together with/prime/prime</prime/primeis denoted byP(M). In [4] it is proved
that ifMis any maniplex, then P(M)is a ﬂagged poset.
It is not diﬃcult to see ([4]) that PandP/primeare isomorphic polytopes if and only if their ﬂag graphs
G(P)andG(P/prime)are isomorphic. This fact implies the following theorem, which can be interpreted
as saying that all the information of the polytope Pis encoded in its ﬂag graph.
Theorem 2.1. [4]LetPbe a polytope and let M=G(P)be its ﬂag graph. Then Pis isomorphic
(as a poset) toP(M)andΓ(P)∼=Γ(M).
ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES 5
Theorem 5.3 of [4] gives a characterization of polytopal maniplexes, that is, those maniplexes that
are isomorphic to the ﬂag graph of some polytope. Such characterization is given in terms of some
path intersection properties of the maniplexes.
Deﬁnition 2.2. LetMbe ann-maniplex. We say that Msatisﬁes the strong path intersection
property (or SPIP) if for every two subsets I,J⊂{0,1,...,n−1}and for any two ﬂags ΦandΨ,
whenever there is a path Wfrom ΦtoΨusing only edges of colors in Iand also a path W/primefrom Φ
toΨusing only edges of colors in J, there also exists a path W/prime/primefrom ΦtoΨthat uses only edges
of colors in I∩J.
We say thatMsatisﬁes the weak path intersection property (or WPIP) if for any two ﬂags Φ
andΨand for all k,m∈{0,1,...,n−1}, whenever there is a path Wfrom ΦtoΨwith only
edges of colors in [0,m] :={0,1,...,m}and a path W/primefrom ΦtoΨwith only edges of colors in
[k,n−1] :={k,k+ 1,...,n−1}, then there is also a path W/prime/primefrom ΦtoΨwith only edges of colors
in[k,m] :={k,k+ 1,...,m}.
Theorem 2.3. [4, Theorem 5.3] LetMbe a maniplex. Then the following conditions are all
equivalent:
• Mis polytopal.
• Msatisﬁes the SPIP.
• Msatisﬁes the WPIP.
In any of these cases P(M)is a polytope whose ﬂag graph is isomorphic to M.
2.1.Premaniplexes and symmetry type graphs. Ak-orbit maniplex is one with exactly kﬂag
orbits under its automorphism group. When studying k-orbit maniplexes with k>1one ﬁnds that
it is convenient to classify them in terms of the local structure of the ﬂags. For this reason, in [2],
Cunningham et al. introduce the concept of symmetry type graph .
Given a maniplex Mand a subgroup Gof the automorphism group of M, thesymmetry type
graph ofMwith respect to G, denoted either by T(M,G)or byM/G, is constructed as follows: The
vertex set ofT(M,G)is the set of ﬂag orbits of Munder the group G, and if ΦandΨarei-adjacent
inMwe draw an edge of color ibetween their orbits. If ΦandΦiare in the same orbit under G,
we draw a semi-edge of color iat the vertex corresponding to that orbit. Note that a semi-edge is
diﬀerent from a loop in that it consists of an edge with only one endpoint, rather than an with two
equal endpoints; that is, a semi-edge is incident to its vertex once, while a loop is incident to its
vertex two times.
When we speak about the symmetry type graph of M, we mean it with respect to Γ(M)and we
simply writeT(M)instead ofT(M,Γ(M)).
IfPis a polytope, the symmetry type graph of P(with respect to G)is deﬁned as the symmetry
type graph (with respect to G) of its ﬂag graph.
IfXis the symmetry type graph of an n-maniplex, then it is a connected graph in which every
vertex is incident to exactly one edge of each color in {0,1,...,n−1}and it satisﬁes that if |i−j|>1,
the paths of length 4 that alternate between the colors iandjare closed. However, it might not be
a maniplex as it is not necessarily simple. We will call such a graph a n-premaniplex .
IfXis a premaniplex and i,j∈{0,1,...,n−1}are non-consecutive, the connected components
of the subgraph of Xinduced by the edges of colors iandjare not necessarily 4-cycles. In fact they
can be any quotient of a 4-cycle, as illustrated in Figure 1.
The notions of homomorphism, isomorphism, automorphism andmonodromy group from mani-
plexes can all be easily extended to premaniplexes as well.
The natural projection p:M→T (M,G)is, of course, a homomorphism (of premaniplexes).

When studying polytopes (or maniplexes) and their symmetry type graphs two natural questions
occur:
•Given a premaniplex X, is there a polytope (or maniplex) whose symmetry type graph is
X? (see Question 1)
•Given a premaniplex X, what conditions must a group Gsatisfy so that there is a polytope
(or maniplex)Psuch thatT(P,G)∼=X?
In Section 4.1 we give a complete answer to the latter. Question 1 remains as a hard question, as
even if we ﬁnd a polytope Pand a group Gsuch thatT(P,G)∼=X, it may still happen that Gis
a proper subgroup of Γ(P). However, in Section 5 we give an inﬁnite family of premaniplexes that
are in fact symmetry type graphs of polytopes.
3.Voltage graphs
The projection p:M→T (M,G)is an example of what is called a regular covering projection
in graph theory (see [5] or [10] for more details). Given a regular covering projection p:/tildewideX→X,
one may recover the graph /tildewideXfrom the graph Xusing what is known as a voltage assignment .
We shall refer to a directed edge as a dart. Theinverseof a dartdis the dartd−1with the same
edge, but diﬀerent orientation. Hence, loops and links (edges between two diﬀerent vertices) have
two darts inverse to each other. In contrast, semi-edges have only one dart, inverse to itself. Given
an edgeewith vertices vandu, if a dartdofehas direction from vtou, we shall say that vis the
initial vertex of d(and denote it by I(d)) anduis the terminal vertex of d(and denote it by T(d)).
Apathin a graph is a ﬁnite sequence of darts W=d1d2...,dksuch that the dart di+1starts
at the endpoint of the dart di. Thestart-point of WisI(d1), and the endpoint of WisT(dk). If
xandyare the start-point and endpoint of W, respectively, we say that Wgoes fromxtoyand
we write this as W:x→y. If the endpoint and start-point of a path Ware the same vertex xwe
say thatWis aclosed path based at x. We also consider that for every vertex xthere is an empty
closed path based at x.
If a pathWends at the start-point of a path V, we may deﬁne the product WVas their
concatenation.
Two paths WandW/primewith the same start-point and endpoint are said to be homotopic if one
can transform WintoW/primeby a ﬁnite sequence of the following operations:
ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES 7
•Inserting two consecutive inverse darts at any point, that is
d1d2...didi+1...dk/mapsto→d1...didd−1di+1...dk,
whereI(d) =T(di);
•Deleting two consecutive inverse darts at any point, that is
d1...didd−1di+1...dk/mapsto→d1d2...didi+1...dk;
In this case we write W∼W/prime.
It is easy to see that homotopy is an equivalence relation and that if W∼W/prime,V∼V/prime, and
Wends at the start-point of V, thenWV∼W/primeV/prime. Therefore, we can think of the product of two
homotopy classes of paths. The set of all homotopy classes of paths in a graph Xwith this operation
is called the fundamental groupoid of Xand it is denoted by Π(X). We will often speak of a "path
WinΠ(X)", but the reader should keep in mind that we are actually referring to its homotopy
class.
The subset of Π(X)consisting of all the (homotopy classes of) closed paths based at a vertex x
forms a group known as the fundamental group of Xbased atxand it is denoted by Πx(X).
Avoltage graph is a pair (X,ξ)whereXis a graph and ξis a groupoid antimorphism from Π(X)
to a group G. In this case we say that ξis avoltage assignment (on X)and we call Gthevoltage
group (ofξ). The element ξ(W)is called the voltage of W.
Note that a voltage assignment is completely determined by the voltages of the darts of the graph,
as the voltage ξ(W)of a pathW=d1d2...dk−1dkis simplyξ(dk)ξ(dk−1)...ξ(d1). In fact, if Dis
the set of darts of a graph X, any function ξ:D→Gcan be extended to a voltage assignment as
long asξ(d−1) =ξ(d)−1for every dart d∈D.
Given a voltage graph (X,ξ)with voltage group G, we can construct the derived graph Xξas
follows:
•The vertex set is V×GwhereVis the vertex set of X.
•The dart set is is D×GwhereDis the dart set of X.
•If the dart dgoes fromxtoy, the dart (d,g)goes from the vertex (x,g)to(y,ξ(d)g).
This is an undirected graph, as the inverse of the dart (d,g)is the dart (d−1,ξ(d)g). Note that for
everyh∈G, the mapping (x,g)/mapsto→(x,gh )is an automorphism of Xξ. That is,Gcan be regarded
as a group of automorphisms of Xξ.
Given a path Wof a graphXstarting at a vertex xand given an element gin the voltage group,
there is a unique path /tildewiderWinXξthat starts at (x,g)that projects to W. The path /tildewiderWis called a
lift ofWand it is easy to see that it ends at (y,ξ(W)g)whereyis the endpoint of W(for details
see [10]).
In our case, we will work with graphs that have a coloring of its edges (and therefore, darts), so
we will deﬁne that the color of the dart (d,g)is the same as the color of d.
It is known (see [5] or [10]) that if p:/tildewideX→Xis a regular covering, there is a voltage assignment
ξsuch that /tildewideXis isomorphic to Xξ. Moreover, given a spanning tree TofX, there is a voltage
assignment ξsuch that /tildewideX∼=Xξandξ(d) = 1for every dart dinT.
3.1.Voltage graphs that give maniplexes as derived graphs. Of course, we want to use
voltage graphs to obtain maniplexes (and polytopes). In this section we shall give necessary and
suﬃcient conditions on a voltage assignment ξon a premaniplex Xso thatXξis a maniplex.
LetMbe a maniplex, Γa group of automorphisms of MandX=T(M,Γ). LetTbe a
spanning tree of X. As mentioned before, there is a voltage assignment ξ: Π(X)→Γsuch thatXξ
8 ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES
is isomorphic toMandξ(d) = 1for every dart dinT. The set of non-trivial voltages of darts in X
then gives a generating set for the group Γ. In fact, if we keep only one element from each pair of
inverse generators, what we get is the set of distinguished generators of Γ, as deﬁned in [2, Section
5].
Conversely, given a premaniplex Xwith fundamental groupoid Π(X), letTbe a spanning tree
ofXand letξ: Π(X)→Γbe a voltage assignment, for some group Γsuch thatξ(d) = 1for every
dartdinT. In what follows, we ﬁnd the conditions on Γandξthat ensure that Xξis actually a
maniplex.
First we want Xξto be connected. It is known (see [10]) that in order for Xξto be connected,
ξ(D)must generate Γ, whereDdenotes the set of darts of X.
Next,Xξmust be a simple graph. Thus, it must not have semi-edges or multiple edges. Note that
a semi-edge of Xξthat starts at a vertex (x,γ)ends in (x,ξ(e)γ) = (x,γ), whereeis a semi-edge
ofX. This implies that if the voltage of every semi-edge of Xis not trivial, we avoid semi-edges
inXξ. Sinceξis an antimorphism we should have that ξ(e) =ξ(e−1) =ξ(e)−1, implying that the
voltage of a semi-edge must have order two.
To avoid multiple edges, we need to avoid diﬀerent darts with the same initial and terminal
vertices; suppose Xξhas two parallel darts (d,σ)and(d/prime,τ). Since both darts start at the same
vertex, we have that (I(d),σ) = (I(d/prime),τ), soI(d) =I(d/prime)andσ=τ. The common end-point of
(d,σ)and(d/prime,τ)could be written as (y,ξ(d)σ)or(z,ξ(d/prime)σ), whereyis the end-point of dandz
the end-point of d/prime. The fact that these two are the same means that y=zandξ(d) =ξ(d/prime). So
(d,σ)and(d/prime,σ)are parallel darts in Xξif and only if dandd/primeare parallel darts in Xwith the
same voltage. Thus, Xξhas no parallel darts if and only if no pair of parallel darts in Xhas equal
voltages.
Finally, we want to ensure that if |i−j|>1, the paths of length 4 in Xξthat alternate colors
betweeniandjare closed. Let /tildewiderWbe one of these paths. Projecting /tildewiderWtoXwe get a path Win
Xof length 4 that alternates colors between iandj, and since Xis a premaniplex we know that
Wis closed. Suppose Wstarts at a vertex x. Then /tildewiderWgoes from a vertex of the form (x,γ)to
(x,ξ(W)γ). So/tildewiderWis closed if and only if ξ(W)γ=γ, or in other words, if Whas trivial voltage.
Summarizing this discussion, we arrive to the following lemma:
Lemma 3.1. LetXbe a premaniplex and let ξ: Π(X)→Γbe a voltage assignment with a spanning
treeTof trivial voltage on all its darts. Then Xξis a maniplex if and only if
(1)The setξ(D)generates Γ, whereDis the set of darts of X,
(2)ξ(d)has order exactly 2 when dis a semi-edge,
(3)ξ(d)/negationslash=ξ(d/prime)whendandd/primeare parallel darts, and
(4)if|i−j|>1every (closed) path Wof length 4 that alternates between the colors iandjhas
trivial voltage.
In Section 4 we shall translate the conditions in Lemma 3.1 to relations and inequalities that
the generators of a group Γneed to satisfy to act on a maniplex with given symmetry type graph
X. Before doing so, let us now take a closer look at the consequences of condition 4 of the above
Lemma.
Condition 4 of Lemma 3.1 invites us to introduce a new concept of homotopy: we say that two
pathsWandW/primearemaniplex-homotopic if we can transform one into the other by a ﬁnite sequence
of inserting or deleting pairs of inverse darts, as well as switching the colors of two consecutive darts
with non-consecutive colors, that is
d1d2...didi+1...dk/mapsto→d1d2...d/prime
id/prime

where, ifc(d)denotes the color of d, we have that|c(di)−c(di+1)|>1, c(d/prime
i) =c(di+1),c(d/prime
i+1) =
c(di),I(d/prime
i) =I(di)andI(d/prime
i+1) =T(d/prime
i). Hence, a voltage assignment ξis well deﬁned when applied
to the maniplex-homotopy class of paths if and only if it satisﬁes Condition 4 of Lemma 3.1. From
this point on, whenever we speak about homotopy, homotopy class, fundamental groupoid, etc. we
will be thinking in terms of maniplex-homotopy.

every voltage group that gives a maniplex should be a quotient of this group, or in other words Γis
the “most general” group we can use as a voltage group to get a maniplex as the derived graph. The
ideas of the proof of Theorem 5.2 of [6] show that X=T(U,G)whereUis the universal polytope of
ranknandGis some group. This means that there is some voltage assignment ξonXwith voltage
groupGsuch thatXξis isomorphic to the ﬂag graph of U. Because of the universality of Uwe get
thatGandΓin fact are the same. In other words, if we use the most general group as our voltage
group we will always get the ﬂag graph of the universal polytope as the derived graph.
4.Intersection properties and coset geometries
In order to prove the Main Theorem, we need to characterize, in terms of generators and relations,
the groups Γthat act by automorphisms on a polytope Pin such a way that the symmetry type
graphT(G(P),Γ)is isomorphic to a given premaniplex X. We shall do this in order to be able to
recover the polytope Pas a coset geometry using the group Γ.
We start with the premaniplex Xand provide it with a voltage assignment ξ. Recall that if
(X,ξ)is a voltage graph with voltage group Γ, thenXξ/Γis isomorphic to X; conversely, ifM/Γ
is isomorphic to Xthen there is a voltage assignment ξonXsuch thatXξis isomorphic toM.
Hence, by characterizing the voltage assignments ξthat satisfy that the derived graph Xξis the ﬂag
graph of a polytope, we determine the conditions that Γmust satisfy to be the automorphism group
of a polytope with symmetry type X.
4.1.Voltagegraphsandthepathintersectionproperty. Wehaveﬁguredouthowtoconstruct
a maniplex from a premaniplex via voltage assignments. It is then natural to ask: when is the
obtained maniplex the ﬂag graph of a polytope? The answer, as we shall see in this section, is closely
related to Theorem 2.3. In fact, translating Theorem 2.3 to the setting of voltage assignments will
give us conditions that take the form of intersection properties that certain distinguished subgroups
and some left cosets must satisfy. Given two vertices x,yinXand a set of colors I∈{0,1,...,n−1},
let us denote by Πx,y
I(X)the set of (homotopy classes of) paths from xtoyinXthat only use darts
with colors in the set I. Soξ(Πx,y
I(X))denotes the set of voltages of all the paths of Xfromxtoy
whose edges have colors in I.
Theorem 4.1. LetXbe a premaniplex and let ξ: Π(X)→Γbe a voltage assignment such that Xξ
is a maniplex. Then Xξis the ﬂag graph of a polytope if and only if
(1) ξ(Πx,y
I(X))∩ξ(Πx,y
J(X)) =ξ(Πx,y
I∩J(X)),
for allI,J⊂{0,...,n−1}and all vertices x,yinX.
ProofStart by assuming that Xξis the ﬂag graph of a polytope. Let xandybe vertices of Xand
letI,J⊂{0,1,...,n−1}. Consider two paths, W∈Πx,y
I(X)andW/prime∈Πx,y
J(X), with the same
voltage, say α∈Γ. When lifting WandW/primeinXξ, they lift to paths /tildewiderWand/tildewiderW/prime, respectively, that go
from (x,1)to(y,α)(here 1 is the identity element of Γ) and satisfying that /tildewiderWuses edges with colors
10 ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES
inIwhile/tildewiderW/primeuses edges with colors in J. In fact, one would deﬁne /tildewiderWand/tildewiderW/primeas the paths that
start at (x,1)and follow the same sequence of colors as WandW/primerespectively. By Theorem 2.3
Xξsatisﬁes the SPIP, which implies that there is a path /tildewiderW/prime/primefrom (x,1)to(y,α)that uses only
colors inI∩J. Then, its projection W/prime/prime:=p(/tildewiderW/prime/prime)is a path in Xthat goes from xtoythat uses
only colors in I∩Jand has voltage α. This proves that ξ(Πx,y
I(X))∩ξ(Πx,y
J(X))⊂ξ(Πx,y
I∩J(X)).
Since the other contention is given, equality (1) must hold.
Now let us assume that equality (1) holds for all I,J⊂{0,1,...,n−1}and all vertices xandy.
Let/tildewiderWand/tildewiderW/primebe paths in Xξfrom a vertex (x,γ)to a vertex (y,τ). LetIandJbe the sets of
colors of darts of /tildewiderWand/tildewiderW/prime, respectively, and let W:=p(/tildewiderW)andW/prime:=p(/tildewiderW/prime)be the projections
of the paths to X. Then, both WandW/primego fromxtoy, andWis a path with colors in I, while
W/primeis a path with colors in J, that is,W∈Πx,y
I(X)andW/prime∈Πx,y
J(X). Furthermore, since /tildewiderWand
/tildewiderW/primestart at (x,γ)and ﬁnish at (y,τ), they both have voltage α:=τγ−1. By hypothesis, there exists
a pathW/prime/prime∈Πx,y
I∩J(X)that also has voltage α. ThenW/prime/primehas a unique lift /tildewiderW/prime/primeinXξstarting at
(x,γ). The path /tildewiderW/prime/primeends in (y,τ)and it uses darts of colors in I∩J. This proves that Xξsatisﬁes
the SPIP and therefore, by Theorem 2.3, it is the ﬂag graph of a polytope. /square
Note that when x=ythe setξ(Πx,y
I(X)) =ξ(Πx
I(X))is a group, since it is the image of a group
under a groupoid antimorphism. Actually, we shall ﬁnd a set of distinguished generators for the
groupξ(Πx
I(X))in a similar way as the distinguished generators of the automorphism group of a
polytope are found in [2]. Recall that XIis the subgraph of Xinduced by the edges with colors in
I. LetXI(x)be the connected component of XIcontaining the vertex x. To ﬁnd a set of generators
ofξ(Πx
I(X)), ﬁx a spanning tree Tx
IforXI(x). For each dart dinXI(x)but not in Tx
Iwe get a
cycleCdof the form WdVwhereWis the unique path contained in Tx
Ifromxto the initial vertex
ofd, andVis the unique path contained in Tx
Ifrom the terminal vertex of dtox. Then, the set
{Cd}, wheredruns among the darts in XI(x)not inTx
I, is a generating set for Πx
I(X). This imples
that{ξ(Cd)}, wheredruns among the darts of XI(x)not inTx
I, is a set of generators for ξ(Πx
I(X)).
Sinceξis a voltage assignment, we might consider only one dart dfor each edge. By denoting by
Wythe unique path contained in Tx
Ifromxtoy, we can see that Πx,y
I(X) = Πx
I(X)Wy(that is, a
path fromxtoycan be written as a closed path starting and ﬁnishing at x, concatenated with Wy),
which implies that ξ(Πx,y
I(X)) =ξ(Wy)ξ(Πx
I(X)). Therefore, all the intersection properties can be
given in terms of left cosets of the groups ξ(Πx
I), whose generators we already know.
Theorem 4.1 gives an intersection property for each pair of vertices (x,y)and each two sets of
colorsI,J⊂{0,1,...,n−1}. If we prove an intersection property for the pair (x,y), by taking the
inverse on both sides we get the corresponding property for the pair (y,x), so we can consider only
unordered pairs{x,y}, and this reduces the number of intersection properties to verify by a factor
of 2. Still, the total number of intersection properties is quadratic on the number of vertices and
exponential on the number of colors. This number gets too big too quickly; however, many of these
properties are redundant, either because they are true for any group (for example, the intersection
of a group and one of its subgroups is the smaller subgroup) or because they are a consequence of
other intersection properties.
Fortunately we may reduce the number of intersection properties to check by following the same
proof but using the weakpath intersection property instead of the strong one. Doing this we get the
following reﬁnement of the previous theorem.
ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES 11
Theorem 4.2. Given a premaniplex Xand a voltage assignment ξsuch thatXξis a maniplex, Xξ
is the ﬂag graph of a polytope if and only if
(2) ξ(Πx,y
[0,m](X))∩ξ(Πx,y
[k,n−1](X)) =ξ(Πx,y
[k,m](X)),
for allk,m∈{0,...,n−1}and allx,y∈F.
With Theorem 4.2 the number of intersection properties to check is now quadratic on the number
of vertices and also quadratic on the rank. We can still reﬁne this theorem a little more with the
following observations:
•The casesk= 0andm=n−1say that the intersection of the whole voltage group with
some subset is the subset itself, so they are trivially true for every voltage assignment.
•In Theorem 4.2 one has to consider the cases when k > m. In such case, ξ(Πx,y
[k,m](X))is
the trivial group when x=yand the empty set when x/negationslash=y. However, if the intersection
property holds for k=m+1, that is, ifξ(Πx,y
[0,m](X))∩ξ(Πx,y
[m+1,n−1](X)) =ξ(Πx,y
∅(X)), then
it also holds for k>m + 1. So one may only verify the intersection property for k≤m+ 1.
•Ifyandy/primeare in the same connected component of X[k,m]and (2) is satisﬁed for the pair
(x,y), then it is also satisﬁed for the pair (x,y/prime). To see this, let Wbe a path from ytoy/prime
with colors in [k,m]and notice that Πx,y/prime
I(X) = Πx,y
I(X)WwheneverIcontains [k,m]. By
taking voltages we get that ξ(Πx,y/prime
I(X)) =ξ(W)ξ(Πx,y
I(X)). This means that we can get the
intersection property for the pair (x,y/prime)by multiplying the one for pair (x,y)byξ(W)on
the left. So for each pair of numbers (k,m)we only need to verify one intersection property
for each pair of connected components of X[k,m].
Taking the previous observations into consideration, the maximum amount of necessary intersec-
tion properties to check is v(v+ 1)/2/summationtextn−2
m=0(m+ 1) =v(v+ 1)n(n−1)/4. But to reach this bound
we need for every vertex to be in a diﬀerent connected component of X[k,m]for every pair (k,m)
with 0<k≤m+ 1, which is only possible when every link has color 0 or n−1. This implies that
every example where this bound is tight has at most 4 vertices (as for n≥3the colors 0andn−1
are not consecutive).
4.2.Constructingapolytopefromthevoltagegroup. Wehaveseenhowtorecoverapolytope
from its ﬂag graph (see Theorem 2.1) and when Xξis the ﬂag graph of a polytope for a given
premaniplex Xand a voltage assignment ξ(see Theorem 4.2). By concatenating the construction of
XξfromXandξ, and the construction of a polytope PfromXξwe get a construction of a polytope
fromXandξ. In this section, we translate this to give a construction only in terms of subgroups of
Γand their cosets. This will give the proof of the Main Theorem.
Letfbe a choice function on the connected subgraphs of X, that is, a function that assigns a base
vertex to each such subgraph. Let Cbe a connected component of XIfor someI⊂{0,1,...,n−1}
and letx=f(C). LetC:= (Xξ)I(x,1), that is, the connected component of (Xξ)Icontaining
(x,1). Thus, if (x,γ)∈C, then there is a path /tildewiderWfrom (x,1)to(x,γ)which uses only colors in
I, which implies that its projection is a closed path WinΠx
I(X)with voltage γ. This means that
when considering the action of ΓonXξ, the stabilizer of Ccoincides with ξ(Πx
I(X)). If we now
consider a coset ξ(Πx
I(X))σ, this would be the set of elements of Γthat mapCto(Xξ)I(x,σ).
We know that the i-faces of the polytope that has Xξas its ﬂag graph correspond to the connected
components of (Xξ)i. This makes natural the following construction:
GivenXandξsatisfying Theorem 4.2 and a choice function fon the connected subgraphs of X,
we will construct a partially ordered set P(X,ξ). We will start by deﬁning the underlying set and
12 ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES
a rank function and deﬁne the order relation later. Let us deﬁne the elements of rank iofP(X,ξ)
as the right cosets of groups of the type ξ(Πx
i(X))where
x∈{f(C)|Cis a connected component of Xi}.
We have to consider these groups as formal copies, that is, if xandx/primeare on diﬀerent connected
components we consider ξ(Πx
i(X))to be diﬀerent than ξ(Πx/prime
i(X)), even if, as groups, they might be
equal. Likewise, if j/negationslash=ibutξ(Πx
i(X))coincides with ξ(Πx/prime
j(X))we consider them to be diﬀerent
inP(X,ξ). We could formalize this by saying that the elements of rank iinP(X,ξ)are pairs
(C,ξ(Πx
i)γ)withCa connected component of Xi,x=f(C)andγ∈Γ, but since xandialready
appear in the notation, we may assume that ξ(Πx
i(X))γstands for the pair (Xi(x),ξ(Πx
i(X))γ).
Now we shall deﬁne the order on P(X,ξ)as follows. First, for all i∈{0,1,...,n−1}and every
vertexyinXwe look at the connected component Xi(y)and ﬁx a path going from its base vertex
x=f(Xi(y))toy. We call this path Wy
iand we denote its voltage by αy
i:=ξ(Wy
i).
Deﬁnition 4.3 (Order inP(X,ξ)).Given 0≤i<j≤n−1, letCbe a connected component of
XiandC/primebe a connected component of Xj, and letxandx/primebe their respective base ﬂags. Given
γ,γ/prime∈Γ, we say that
ξ(Πx
i(X))γ <ξ (Πx/prime
j(X))γ/primeif and only if αy
iξ(Πx
i(X))γ∩αy
jξ(Πx/prime
j(X))γ/prime/negationslash=∅,
for somey∈C∩C/prime.
Theorem 4.4. LetXbe a premaniplex and ξ: Π(X)→Γa voltage assignment satisfying Theo-
rem 4.2. Let
P(X,ξ) :={ξ(Πx(C))τ:Cis a connected component of Xi
for somei∈[0,n−1],x=f(C),τ∈Γ},
together with the order given in Deﬁnition 4.3. Then P(X,ξ)is a polytope in which Γacts by right
multiplication with symmetry type graph X.
Note that Γmight not be the full automorphism group of P(X,ξ), and thusXmight not be the
symmetry type graph of P(X,ξ)with respect to its full automorphism group.
ProofLet us denoteP(Xξ)asPandP(X,ξ)asQ. Note that Theorem 4.2 implies that Pis a
polytope, and we want to show that Qis also a polytope (such that Q/Γ∼=X).
By the discussion in Section 3.1, T(P,Γ)∼=X, since, by construction of Xξ, we have that
Xξ/Γ∼=X. So in order to settle the theorem it is enough to ﬁnd a poset isomorphism ϕ:P→Q
such that it commutes with the action of Γ, that is, such that /tildewideCσϕ =/tildewideCϕσfor all faces /tildewideCinQand
allσ∈Γ.
Let/tildewideCbe a face ofP. Hence, /tildewideCis a connected component of Xξ
ifor some color i. LetC:=p(/tildewideC)
and letx:=f(C). This implies that /tildewideChas a ﬂag (x,γ)for someγ∈Γ. Let/tildewideKbe the connected
component of Xξ
ithat contains (x,1). Then, the set of elements of Γthat map /tildewideKto/tildewideCisξ(Πx
i(X))γ.
We want to identify /tildewideCwith this coset, so we deﬁne /tildewideCϕ:=ξ(Πx
i(X))γ. Note that ϕ:P→Qis well
deﬁned, since if (x,γ/prime)is in/tildewideCthenγ/primeγ−1stabilizes /tildewideK, implying that γ/primeγ−1∈ξ(Πx
i(X)). We want
to prove that ϕis a poset isomorphism and that it commutes with Γ.
Let us show ﬁrst that ϕcommutes with the action of Γ. Let/tildewideCbe a face inPand letσ∈Γ.
By the deﬁnition of ϕwe know that /tildewideCϕ=ξ(Πx
i(X))γwhereiis the rank of /tildewideC,x=f(p(/tildewideC))
andγ∈Γis any element such that (x,γ)∈/tildewideC. On the other hand (/tildewideCσ)ϕ=ξ(Πx/prime
i(X))γ/primewhere
ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES 13
x/prime=f(p(/tildewideCσ))and(x/prime,γ/prime)∈/tildewideCσ. Also note that since /tildewideCand/tildewideCσare in the same orbit, then
p(/tildewideC) =p(/tildewideCσ), and thusx=x/prime. Furthermore, the ﬂag (x,γσ ) = (x,γ)σis in/tildewideCσ. This proves that
(/tildewideCσ)ϕ=ξ(Πx
i(X))γσ= (/tildewideCϕ)σ.
Now let us prove that ϕis an isomorphism of posets. Let /tildewideCand/tildewideC/primebe incident faces of Pof
ranksiandj, respectively, with i < j(therefore, /tildewideC </tildewideC/prime). Hence, there is a ﬂag (y,τ)in/tildewideC∩/tildewideC/prime,
which in turn implies that its ﬁrst entry, y, must be in C∩C/primewhereC=p(/tildewideC)andC/prime=p(/tildewideC/prime).
Letx=f(C)andx/prime=f(C/prime). Note that the path Wy
ifromxtoyis contained in C, whileWy
j
fromx/primetoyis contained in C/prime. Then, these paths have lifts /tildewiderWy
iand/tildewiderWy
jrespectively, that go from
(x,(αy
i)−1τ)and(x/prime,(αy
j)−1τ), respectively, to (y,τ). Observe that /tildewiderWy
iis contained in /tildewideCand/tildewiderWy
j
is contained in /tildewideC/prime. Thus, (αy
i)−1τ∈ξ(Πx
i(X))γand(αy
j)−1τ∈ξ(Πx/prime
j(X))γ/prime. Therefore
τ∈αy
iξ(Πx

jξ(Πx/prime
j(X))γ/prime=αy
i(/tildewideCϕ)∩αy
j(/tildewideC/primeϕ);
but this means that /tildewideCϕ</tildewideC/primeϕinQ.
Conversely, suppose that /tildewideCϕ </tildewideC/primeϕinQ. We want to show that /tildewideC </tildewideC/primeinXξ. Let us write
/tildewideCϕ=ξ(Πx
i(X))γ, whereiis the rank of /tildewideC,x:=f(p(/tildewideC))andγis an element of the voltage group
suchthat (x,γ)∈/tildewideC. Similarly, wewrite /tildewideC/primeϕ=ξ(Πx/prime
j(X))γ/prime, wherejistherankof /tildewideC/prime,x:=f(p(/tildewideC/prime))
andγ/primeis an element of the voltage group such that (x/prime,γ/prime)∈/tildewideC/prime.
By hypothesis αy
iξ(Πx
i(X))γandαy
jξ(Πx/prime
j(X))γ/primehave non-empty intersection for some y∈C∩C/prime.
Letτbe an element in such intersection. Then (αy
i)−1τ∈ξ(Πx
i(X))γ. This implies that (x,(αy
i)−1τ)
is in the same connected component of (Xξ)ias(x,γ), that is (x,(αy
i)−1τ)∈/tildewideC. But at the same
time,thereisaliftof Wy

implies that (y,τ)∈/tildewideC/prime. Thus, we have proved that /tildewideC∩/tildewideC/primeis not empty, or in other words /tildewideC </tildewideC/prime
inP.
Therefore,ϕis an isomorphism and the theorem follows. /square
5.Example: Caterpillars
If one wants to build polytopes from premaniplexes in the way we have described in this paper,
it is natural to start with inﬁnite families of premaniplexes. One could, of course, then start with
premaniplexes with a ﬁxed number kof vertices. For example, one may want to construct 2-orbit
polytopes (see [9]). If, on the other hand, we do not want to limit the number of vertices of the
premaniplexes in the family a ﬁrst step could be to consider trees. However, since semi-edges are
considered as cycles, there are no premaniplexes of rank n≥3whose underlying graph (without
colors) is a tree. Thus, we study the closest thing to them: premaniplexes that are trees with an
unlimited number of semi-edges. Hence, we deﬁne a caterpillar as a premaniplex in which every
cycle is a semi-edge. In other words, a caterpillar is a premaniplex Xwith a unique spanning tree.
In particular, a caterpillar does not have pairs of parallel links (edges joining diﬀerent vertices).
If there are three links incident to one vertex, at least two of them must have colors diﬀering by
more than 1, which would imply that there is a 4-cycle. This implies that caterpillars consist in fact
of a single path W(which we will call the underlying path of X) and lots of semi-edges. Of course,
the colors of two consecutive edges on the path must diﬀer by exactly one, otherwise there would be
14 ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES
x0x1x2x3xkc1c2c3
Figure 2. A ﬁnite caterpillar.
a 4-cycle. We note here that the term caterpillar has been used in the graph theory literature for a
very similar but slightly diﬀerent concept.
Throughout this section, unless otherwise stated, Xwill denote a ﬁnite caterpillar (that is, one
with a ﬁnite number of vertices) with underlying path W, and its vertices will be labeled by
x0,x1,...,xk, ordered as they are visited by W. Furthermore, we denote by (xi,j)the dart of
colorjatxiand bycithe color of the link connecting xi−1andxi.
5.1.Caterpillar coverings. We want to construct polytopes from caterpillars. As often when
constructing maniplexes and polytopes via voltage assignments from a premaniplex X, the derived
maniplex might not have Xas the symmetry type graph with respect to the full automorphism
group. However, the actual symmetry type graph is a quotient of X. For this reason, in this section
we study quotients of caterpillars.
Given a caterpillar, let us call an endpoint a vertex incident to just one link (that is, an endpoint
of the underlying path). Note that a caterpillar is ﬁnite if and only if it has exactly two endpoints.
Every symmetry of the caterpillar must map endpoints to endpoints. If a caterpillar is ﬁnite there is
at most one non-trivial symmetry and its action on the vertices x0,x1,...,xkis given byxj/mapsto→xk−j.
We call a ﬁnite caterpillar symmetric if it has a non-trivial symmetry.
Awordwin{0,1,...,n−1}is simply a ﬁnite sequence w=a1a2...at, withai∈{0,1,...,n−1}
for eachi= 1,2,...,t. Theinverseof a wordwis the word w−1that has the same colors as wbut
written in reverse order. That is, if w=a1a2...atthenw−1=atat−1...a 1. A word is said to be
reducedif it has no occurrence of the same color twice in a row; in other words, w=a1a2...atis
reduced if and only if ai+1/negationslash=aifor alli= 1,2,...,t−1. We shall work with reduced words from
now on. A word w=a1a2...atis apalindrome ifai=at+1−ifor alli∈{1,2,...,t}. A palindrome
of even length can be written as vv−1for some word vand cannot be reduced. A palindrome of odd
length can always be written as w=vav−1for some color aand some word v.
Given a segment [x,y]in a caterpillar, its underlying word is the word wconsisting of the colors
of the links in the path that goes from xtoy. When we speak of the underlying word of a caterpillar
Xwe are referring to the underlying word of its underlying path in a ﬁxed orientation. Hence, we
say that a segment [x,y]is apalindrome if its underlying word vis a palindrome.
Proposition 5.1. LetXbe a ﬁnite caterpillar and let Ybe a premaniplex not isomorphic to X
such that there is a premaniplex homomorphism h:X→Y. ThenYis a caterpillar. Moreover, if
Yhas at least 2 vertices and S=c1c2...ckis the underlying word of X, then there is some r <k
such thatw=c1c2...cris the underlying word of Yand one of the following statements is true:
(1)There exist colors a1,a2,...,at∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}andb1,b2...,bt−1∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}such
thatS=wa1w−1b1wa2w−1b2...bt−1watw−1.
(2)There exist colors a1,a2,...,at∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}andb1,b2...,bt∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}such
thatS=wa1w−1b1wa2w−1b2...bt−1watw−1btw.
In any case, if i≡jmod 2r+ 2thenh(xi) =h(xj). Also ifi≡−j−1 mod 2r+ 2then
h(xi) =h(xj).

Figure 3. The caterpillar Xcovers the caterpillar Yif and only if it “folds” into it.
Before proving Proposition 5.1 let us remark that it simply means that the quotients of a cater-
pillarXare those caterpillars Ysuch thatXcan be “folded” into Y. We illustrate this concept in
Figure 3: the semi-edges are not drawn and the names of the vertices have been omitted, but the
idea is that Xmust be “folded” into “layers” of r+ 1vertices and then each vertex will be projected
to the vertex on Yin the same horizontal coordinate. The layer /lscriptconsists of the vertices xiwhere/floorleftBig
i
r+1/floorrightBig
=/lscript(⌊x⌋denotes the integer part of x). Even layers go from left to right, while odd layers go
from right to left, hence the underlying word of even layers is w=c1c2...crwhile the underlying
word of odd layers is w−1=crcr−1...c 1.
Now let us proceed with the proof.
Proof of Proposition 5.1 Let us consider the equivalence relation ∼honXgiven byx∼hyif and
only ifh(x) =h(y). Recall that by the deﬁnition of a premaniplex homomorphism x∼hyimplies
thatxm∼hymfor every monodromy m. Therefore Yis isomorphic to X/∼h.
We already know that all premaniplex homomorphisms are surjective (see Section 2). By hy-
pothesishis not an isomorphism, which implies it cannot be injective. Let xandybe two diﬀerent
vertices on Xsuch thatx∼hy. Letx0,x1,...,xkbe the sequence of vertices in the underlying
path ofX. There is a monodromy msuch thatxm=x0, and sox0∼hymandymis diﬀerent than
x0. Now letqbe the minimum positive number such that xq∼hx0. We know that qexists because
x0∼hym. Note that if q= 1we would have that xi
0∼hx0for alli, which would imply that the
same is true for x1and in turn also for x2=xc2
1and so on. This would mean that all the vertices
ofXare equivalent, meaning that Yhas only one vertex and the proposition follows. So we may
assume that q>1.
We know that xq−1=xcqqis equivalent xcq
0. Ifcq/negationslash=c1, we would have that xcq
0=x0. This
would imply that xq−1is equivalent to x0, contradicting the minimality of q. So we have proven
thatcq=c1.

Now note that if for some /lscriptwe have that x/lscript∼hx1, thenxc1
/lscript∼hxc1
1=x0. In particular this tells
us that for /lscript < q−1,x/lscriptcannot be equivalent to x1. Now we can use the same argument we used
to prove that cq=c1to prove that cq−1=c2. Analogously we can prove that c3=cq−2,c4=cq−3
and so on. In other words, [x0,xq]is a palindrome. Since for all i,ciandci+1are diﬀerent, then
qis odd, say q= 2r+ 1. Letvbe the underlying word of the segment [x0,xq]. Thenvmay be
written as v=wcr+1w−1for some word w=c1c2...cr. Let us call a1:=cr+1and note that
a1∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}.
For alli= 0,1,...,k, let us denote by /hatwideithe residue of dividing iby2r+ 2. We will prove by
induction on ithatxi∼hx/hatwideifor alli= 0,1,...,kand thatci=c/hatwideiwheniis not divisible by r+ 1,
ci∈{c1+1,c1−1}ifiis an even multiple of r+1andci={cr+1,cr−1}wheniis an odd multiple
ofr+ 1.
Let our induction hypothesis be that x/lscript∼hx/hatwide/lscriptfor all/lscript<i, and thatc/lscript=c/hatwide/lscriptif/lscriptis not divisible
byr+ 1.
Let us start with the case when i≡0 mod 2r+ 2. In this case we want to prove that xi∼hx/hatwidei
and thatci∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}. By our induction hypothesis we know that xi−1∼hx2r+1∼hx0and
ci−1=c2r+1=c1. In particular ci∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}. This implies that xi=xci
i−1∼hxci
0=x0=x/hatwidei
(sinceci/negationslash=c1). Thusisatisﬁes our claim.
Now let us proceed with the case when iis an odd multiple of r+ 1, that is /hatwidei=r+ 1. In this
case we want to prove that xi∼hx/hatwideiand thatci∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}. Our induction hypothesis tells
us thatxi−1∼hxrand thatci−1=cr. Henceci∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}. Note that one of the colors
in{cr+ 1,cr−1}is actuallycr+1, while the other is the color of a semi-edge incident to xr. Since
xr+1∼hxrwe have that xi=xci
i−1∼hxcir∼hxr∼hxr+1=x/hatwidei. Thusisatisﬁes our claim.
Finally let us prove our claim for the case when iis not divisible by r+ 1. Our induction
hypothesis tells us that xi−1∼hx/hatwidei−1. Note that /hatwidei=/hatwidei−1 + 1. Sinceiis not a multiple of r+ 1
we know that x/hatwidei=xc/hatwidei
/hatwidei−1is not equivalent to x/hatwidei−1. This implies that xc/hatwidei
i−1is not equivalent to
xi−1, and since it is adjacent to xi−1it must be equal to either xiorxi−2. Ifi≡1 mod 2r+ 2
then, by induction hypothesis, xi−1∼hx0, but recall that x0∼hx2r+1=xqby deﬁnition, and
by induction hypothesis xi−2∼hx/hatwidei−2=x2r+1. This means that xi−2∼hxi−1, soxc/hatwidei
i−1must
bexi, implying that ci=c/hatwidei. Similarly, if i≡r+ 2 mod 2r+ 2, using our induction hypothesis
we get that xi−1∼hxr+1∼hxr∼hxi−2, which implies that xc/hatwidei
i−1=xiand again we get that
ci=c/hatwidei. Ifi/negationslash≡1 modr+ 1then our induction hypothesis tells us that ci−1=c/hatwidei−1/negationslash=c/hatwidei, and since
xi−2=xci−1
i−1=xc/hatwidei−1
i−1, the only possibility is that xc/hatwidei
i−1=xi, implying that ci=c/hatwideiand thatxi∼hx/hatwidei.
Thus,isatisﬁes our claim. Note that we have also proven that if iis not divisible by r+ 1thenxi−1
cannot be an endpoint of X.
We have proved that xi∼hx/hatwideifor alli= 0,1,...,k. This implies automatically that if i≡
jmod 2r+ 2thenxi∼hxj. Moreover, if i≡−j−1 mod 2r+ 2, then/hatwidei= 2r+ 1−/hatwidej. Now
sincevis a palindrome, we know that x/lscript∼hx2r+1−/lscriptfor all/lscript= 0,1,..., 2r+ 1, in particular
x/hatwidei=x2r+1−/hatwidej∼hx/hatwidej. This, together with the fact that xi∼hx/hatwideiandxj∼hx/hatwidej, implies that
xi∼hxj.
We have already proved that S=wa1w−1b1wa2w−1...and it ends after an occurrence of wor
w−1. To end the proof note that since his surjective we already know exactly what premaniplex Y
is: It is a caterpillar with vertex sequence h(x0),h(x1),...,h (xr). In fact, for i= 1,...,r−1and
j= 0,1,...n−1we know that h(xi)is diﬀerent from h(xi)j=h(xj
i)if and only if j∈{ci−1,ci};
and ifi= 0(resp.r) thenh(xi)is diﬀerent from h(xi)jif and only if j=c1(resp.cr). /square
ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES 17
If we look closely at the proof of Proposition 5.1 we notice that we have not actually used the
fact thatXis ﬁnite, but only the fact that it has at least one endpoint. So the proposition may be
generalized as follows:
Proposition 5.2. LetXbe a caterpillar with at least one endpoint and let Ybe a premaniplex
such that there is a premaniplex homomorphism (or covering) h:X→Y. ThenYis a caterpillar.
Moreover, if Yhas at least two vertices and S=c1c2...is the color sequence of Xstarting at its
endpoint, then there is some rsuch thatw=c1c2...cris the underlying word of Yand there exist
colorsa1,a2,...∈{cr+1,cr−1}andb1,b2...∈{c1+1,c1−1}such thatS=wa1w−1b1wa2w−1b2....
IfXis ﬁnite it ends after an occurrence of either worw−1. Ifi≡jmod 2r+2thenh(xi) =h(xj).
Ifi≡jor−j−1 mod 2r+ 2, thenh(xi) =h(xj).
Let us look now at the degenerate cases. If Yis only one vertex we can think that the previous
theorems still hold but with wbeing the empty word, and since c1andcrdo not exist, we get rid
of the restrictions ai∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}andbi∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}. In Figure 3 each layer of Xwould
have only one vertex and no links; essentially Xwould be “standing up” instead of being folded. If
Yis isomorphic to XthenS=wand we do not have any aiorbi. In Figure 3 Xwould have only
one layer.
If one would try to prove an analogous result as Proposition 5.2 for caterpillars with no ends,
there would be two additional cases to consider: One would be when Yis a caterpillar with one
endpoint with an underlying sequence of colors S=c1c2c3,.... In this case, the underlying inﬁnite
word ofXwould beS−1aSfor some color a, whereS−1=...c 3c2c1. The other case would be that
whenYis not a caterpillar but a premaniplex consisting of a cycle with underlying word wand all
the edges not in the cycle are semiedges. In this case Xwould have the underlying inﬁnite word
···www···.
5.2.Caterpillars as STG of polytopes. Given a caterpillar X, we want to assign voltages to the
semi-edges of Xin order to get the ﬂag graph of a polytope as the derived maniplex. To this end,
we note that in caterpillars the conditions of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 can be simpliﬁed, as stated in
the following lemma:
Lemma 5.3. LetXbe a caterpillar and let ξ: Π(X)→Γbe a voltage assignment such that all the
darts in the underlying path of Xhave trivial voltage. Then the following statements are equivalent.
(1)Xξis polytopal.
(2)For every vertex xinXand all sets I,J⊂{0,1,...,n−1}the equation
ξ(Πx
I(X))∩ξ(Πx
J(X)) =ξ(Πx
I∩J(X))
holds.
(3)For every vertex xinXand allk,m∈{0,1,...,n−1}the equation
ξ(Πx
[0,m](X))∩ξ(Πx
[k,n−1](X)) =ξ(Πx
[k,m](X))
holds.
ProofToprovethiswehavetoseethatforeverysetofcolors I⊂{0,1,...,n−1}thesetξ(Πx,y
I(X))
is eitherξ(Πx
I(X))or empty, depending on whether or not the segment of Wthat goes from xtoy
(which we will denote [x,y]) uses only colors in I. In fact if [x,y]uses only colors in Ithen
ξ(Πx,y
I(X)) =ξ(Πx
I(X)[x,y]) =ξ([x,y])ξ(Πx
I(X)) = 1·ξ(Πx
I(X)) =ξ(Πx
I(X)).
18 ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES
Note also that ξ(Πx,y
I(X))∩ξ(Πx,y
J(X))is empty if and only if one of the factors is empty. These
observations together with Theorems 4.1 prove the equivalence between conditions 1 and 2, and with
Theorem 4.2 we prove the equivalence between conditions 1 and 3, thus proving the lemma. /square
Recall that a Boolean group (or anelementary Abelian 2-group) is a group in which every non-
trivial element has order exactly 2. Thus, all Boolean groups are Abelian, and ﬁnitely generated
Boolean groups are isomorphic to a direct product of cyclic groups of order 2.
Proposition 5.4. Every caterpillar is the quotient of the ﬂag graph of a polytope by a Boolean
group.
ProofLetXbe a caterpillar. We shall ﬁnd a Boolean group Band a voltage assignment ξ:
Π(X)→Bsuch thatXξis polytopal in the following way.
First assign trivial voltage to all links of Wand a diﬀerent independent voltage to each semi-
edge incident to x0. We shall give voltage assignments to the semi-edges (xi,j), recursively on i.
If|j−ci|>1we assign the same voltage to (xi,j)as we did to (xi−1,j). On the ohter hand, if
|j−ci|= 1, we assign a new element as the voltage (xi,j)independent from all the voltages of
previous darts.
Let us call the resulting voltage group Band denote this voltage assignment by ξ. By Lemma 3.1,
Xξis a maniplex.
Note further that ξsatisﬁes that if i∈{1,2,...,k};r,s∈{0,1,...,n−1}and(xi−1,r)and
(xi,s)are semi-edges, then ξ(xi,s) =ξ(xi−1,r)if and only if r=sand|r−ci|/negationslash= 1. It also satisﬁes
that ifi</lscript<j and(xi,r)and(xj,r)are semi-edges such that ξ(xi,r) =ξ(xj,r) =γ, then (x/lscript,r)
is also a semi-edge and ξ(x/lscript,r) =γ.
We claim that the second statement of Lemma 5.3 is satisﬁed, and hence, Xξis the ﬂag graph
of a polytope. To show that this is the case, start by noticing that ξ(Πx
I)is the group generated by
the voltages of the semi-edges on the component XI(x).
GivenI,J⊆{0,1,...,n−1}, suppose that for some vertex xthere is a semi-edge einXI(x)
and a semi-edge e/primeinXJ(x)withξ(e) =ξ(e/prime) =γfor someγ∈Γ. Ife=e/primethene∈XI∩J(x).
Ife/negationslash=e/prime, thene= (xi,r)ande/prime= (xj,r)for somei,j∈{0,...,k−1}andr∈{0,...,n−1};
in particular r∈I∩J. Ifx∈[xi,xj]then, as previously observed, ξ(x,r) =γ(see Figure 4) and
since (x,r)∈XI∩J(x)this means γis a generator of ξ(Πx
I∩J). Ifx /∈[xi,xj]consider without loss
of generality that xiis further away from xthanxj, in other words, that xj∈[xi,x](see Figure 5).
Then [xi,x]uses only colors in Iand[xj,x]⊂[xi,x]uses only colors in J. Then since [xj,x]⊂[xi,x]
we know that [xj,x]uses only colors in I∩J, meaning that e/prime∈XI∩J(x)and since its voltage is γ,
this shows that γis always a generator of ξ(Πx
I∩J). Therefore, we have shown that if γis a generator
of bothξ(Πx
I(X))andξ(Πx
J(X)), then it is also a generator of ξ(Πx
I∩J(X)).
Now letσ∈ξ(Πx
I(X))∩ξ(Πx
J(X))be arbitrary. Since the group Bis Boolean, σmay be writtenas
σ=γ1γ2...γswheretheelements γ1,γ2,...,γsarediﬀerentgeneratorsof B, andthisdecomposition
is unique up to reordering of the factors. Since σ∈ξ(Πx
I(X)), and because the voltage of a semi-
edge is always a generator, each γiis also inξ(Πx
I(X)), and since σ∈ξ(Πx
J(X))eachγiis also
inξ(Πx
J(X)). But, this implies that each γiis inξ(Πx
I∩J(X)), implying that σ∈ξ(Πx
I∩J(X)).
Therefore,ξ(Πx
I)∩ξ(Πx
J) =ξ(Πx
I∩J). /square
The ﬂag graphs of the polytopes constructed in the proof of Proposition 5.4 have some 4-cycles
consisting of edges of consecutive colors. For this reason we say that they are degenerated .
Proposition 5.4 is still true for inﬁnite caterpillars. Even if our algorithmic way of assigning
voltages may not be doable, the voltage assignment is still well deﬁned as a quotient of the Boolean
group with one generator assigned to each semi-edge.

Note that Proposition 5.4 says that every caterpillar Xis a symmetry type graph of a polytope
Pwith respect to some group B≤Γ(P). However, Xis not necessarily the symmetry type graph
ofPwith respect to the full automorphism group. That is, Xξmight have “extra” symmetry.
Thus, we would want to investigate what could be the symmetry type of Xξwith respect to its full
automorphism group.
LetXbe a ﬁnite caterpillar and let ξ: Π(X)→Bbe the voltage assignment constructed in
the proof of Proposition 5.4. If Xis symmetric, its non-trivial symmetry induces an automorphism
ofBwhich is just a reordering of the generators, moreover, if the generators are given the natural
order, it induces the reverse order on the generators. Using [10, Theorem 7.1], we get that this
symmetry induces a symmetry of the derived maniplex, so in this case the original caterpillar is
not the symmetry type of the derived polytope. But we will see in Theorem 5.5 that if Xis not
symmetric, we can almost be certain that the caterpillar is in fact the symmetry type graph of the
derived polytope by its full automorphism group. In this case, by “almost” we mean that if this is
not the case, the caterpillar must have a very speciﬁc structure.
Theorem 5.5. LetXbe a ﬁnite caterpillar of length kand rankn. LetS=c1c2...ckbe the
underlying word of X. Then at least one of the following statements is true:
(1)Xis symmetric.
(2)Xis the STG of a polytope with a Boolean automorphism group.

ProofSuppose that Xis not symmetric and that it is not the STG of a polytope with a Boolean
automorphism group.
Consider the voltage assignment ξ: Π(X)→Bpreviously discussed. We say that two vertices x
andyofXare equivalent ( x∼y) if there exist (or equivalently, for all) σ,τ∈Bsuch that the ﬂags
(x,σ)and(y,τ)ofXξare in the same orbit under the action of the automorphism group of Xξ.
Then∼is an equivalence relation preserved by i-adjacency, that is x∼y⇒xi∼yi. Moreover, the
natural function h:X→X/∼is a premaniplex homomorphism, so by Proposition 5.1 there exists
somersuch thatScan be written as wa1w−1b1wa2w−1b2...ending after an occurrence of either
worw−1, wherew=c1c2...cr,ai∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}andbi∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}(see Figure 3). In
fact,X/∼is isomorphic to the actual symmetry type graph of Xξ(mapping the orbit of (x,γ)to
the equivalence class of xis an isomorphism).
Note that since Xis not symmetric nor the STG of Xξwith respect to B, at leastb1exists.
Letj∈{0,1...,k−1}be a number such that the segment [x0,xj+1]has the underlying word
wa1w−1b1wa2w−1b2...w−1bifor somei. We know in particular that bidiﬀers from c1in exactly
1. We want to prove that (c1,bi)∈{(1,0),(n−2,n−1)}. We will assume this is not the case and
arrive to a contradiction.
Letqbe theothercolor that diﬀers from biin exactly 1 (that is q= 2bi−c1). Since (c1,bi)/negationslash=
(1,0),(n−2,n−1)we know that q∈{0,1,...,n−1}, and thus is the color of some edges of X. So
there are semi-edges e,e/primeincident to x0of colorsqandbirespectively. Let α:=ξ(e)andβ:=ξ(e/prime).
The voltage of the closed path ee/primeee/primeis(βα)2= 1becauseBis Boolean. This means that its lift,
(the path of length 4 that starts at (x,1)inXξand alternates colors between qandbi) must be
closed.
By Theorem 5.1, we know that cj+1=c1/negationslash=q, so we know that the darts (xj+1,q)and(xj,q)
are semi-edges. Let κ:=ξ(xj,q)andλ=ξ(xj+1,q). The path of length 4 that alternates colors
betweenrandbiand starts at xjis closed, and its voltage is λκ. Note that since |q−bi|= 1the
deﬁnition of ξtells us that ξ(xj,q)/negationslash=ξ(xj+1,q), that isλ/negationslash=κ, which implies λκ/negationslash= 1. This means
that the path of length 4 in Xξstarting at (xj,1)and alternating colors between randbiis not
closed (it ends at (xj,λκ)).
We see that the path of length 4 in Xξstarting at (xj,1)and alternating colors between rand
cj+1is not closed, but the one starting at (x0,1)is. This contradicts the fact that (xj,1)and
(x0,1)are on the same orbit. The contradiction comes from the fact that there are edges of color
q= 2bi−c1∈{0,1,...,n−1}, so to avoid this we must have that (c1,bi)∈{(1,0),(n−2,n−1)}.
Sincec1is ﬁxed, every bimust be the same.
ALL POLYTOPES ARE COSET GEOMETRIES 21
If the underlying word of Xends after an occurrence of wwe may look at Xin the other
direction. Then the previous result tells us that every aiis equal to some aand that (cr,a)∈
{(1,0),(n−2,n−1)}. /square
Remark 5.6.If the third or fourth condition is the one holding in Theorem 5.5, the actual STG of
Xξmight be the ﬁnite caterpillar with underlying word w.
By doing exactly the same proof, we obtain the following analogous result for inﬁnite caterpillars
with one end-point (this would look like a ray or half-straight line):
Theorem 5.7. LetXbe an inﬁnite caterpillar with one end-point. Let Sbe the sequence of colors
of the underlying path of Xstarting at its end-point. Then one of the following statements is true:
(1)Xis the STG of a polytope with a Boolean automorphism group.
(2)Thereexist somenumber randcolorsb,a1,a2,...∈{0,1,...,n−1}such thatS=wa1w−1bwa2w−1bwa3w−1...
wherew=c1c2...crand(c1,b)∈{(1,0),(n−2,n−1)}.
Remark 5.8.If the second condition is the one holding, the actual STG of Xξmight be the ﬁnite
caterpillar with underlying word w.
Ifk≥3, it is easy to construct a caterpillar of length k−1(that is, with kvertices and k−1
links) that does not satisfy properties (1),(3)and(4)(simply let c1= 0and then avoid the color 0
for every other ci). Hence, we get the following corollary:
Corollary 5.9. For everyn,k≥3, there is an abstract n-polytope with Boolean automorphism
group that has kﬂag orbits.

Abstract
Abstract polytopes generalize the classical notion of convex polytopes to
more general combinatorial structures. The most studied ones are regular and
chiral polytopes, as it is well-know they can be constructed as coset geometries

from their automorphism groups. This is also known to be true for 2- and
3- orbit 3-polytopes. In this paper we show that every abstract n-polytope
can be constructed as a coset geometry. This construction is done by giving a
characterization, in terms of generators, relations and intersection conditions,
of the automorphism group of a k-orbit polytope with given symmetry type
graph. Furthermore, we use these results to show that for all k/negationslash= 2, there
existk-orbitn-polytopes with Boolean groups (elementary abelian 2-groups) as
automorphism group, for all n≥3.
1 Introduction
In the 1970s several ideas extend the geometric study of convex polytopes to
generalize them from diﬀerent points of view: while Tits studied incidence sys-
tems, Coxeter focused on tessellations of manifolds and Grünbaum proposed to
move away from spherical tiles. In the early 1980s Danzer and Schulte put sev-
eral of these ideas together to start the study of incidence polytopes , now called
abstract polytopes . An abstract polytope is a ranked, partially ordered set which
generalizes the face lattice of convex polytopes and tessellations. Thus, abstract
polytopes generalize the classical notion of convex polytopes and tessellations
to more general combinatorial structures.
The degree of symmetry of an abstract polytope is measured by counting the
numberofﬂagorbitsundertheactionofitsautomorphismgroup, whereaﬂagis
a maximal chain of the partial order. Abstract polytopes can then be classiﬁed
in terms of their so-called symmetry type graph ([2]), which encodes all the
information of the local conﬁguration of ﬂags with respect to the automorphism
group.
Polytopeswithonlyoneﬂag-orbitarecalled regularandarethemoststudied
2
ones. Regular polytopes have maximal degree of symmetry and in particular
their groups are generated by involutions, often called “(abstract) reﬂections”.
The book [11] is the standard reference and it is devoted exclusively to the study
of abstract regular polytopes. There are 2n−1classes of n-polytopes with 2 ﬂag
orbits, each of them corresponding to one symmetry type graph. Among them
is the class of chiralpolytopes ([14]), which have no “reﬂectional” symmetry,
but have maximal “rotational” one.
The study of coset geometries goes back to Tits ([15]). The ideas behind
thisconceptaretoconstructincidencestructuresusinggroups, andinparticular
were developed by Tits in connection to Coxeter groups. It is well-known that
regular and chiral polytopes, as well as two-orbit polyhedra can be seen as coset
geometries (see [3], [14] and [7]); this characterization of their automorphism
groups constitute the most important tool to study them. In a recent paper
([8]), we showed that also 3-orbit polyhedra can be seen as cosets and used this
to construct 3-orbit polyhedra from symmetric groups.
The purpose of this paper is to show the following theorem.
Main Theorem. Every abstract polytope can be constructed as a coset geome-
try.
To show this, we characterize the automorphism group of an abstract poly-
tope with a given symmetry type graph, in terms of generators and relations,
as well as some intersection conditions on some subgroups and cosets.

As pointed out before, symmetry type graphs are a great tool to classify
polytopes(andmaniplexes)intermsoftheirautomorphismgroups. Wewillrely
on them heavily in our study. There are some (necessary) conditions a graph
3
must satisfy to be the symmetry type graph of a maniplex or polytope. Graphs
satisfying such conditions are called premaniplexes (or admissible graphs) and
will be properly deﬁned in Section 2.1. We believe our main theorem will shed
light to the study of k-orbit polytopes, at the time that opens the gate to study
one of the main problems in the area (listed as Problem 12 in [1]):
Question1. Givenapremaniplex,doesitexistapolytope(ormaniplex)having
such premaniplex as its symmetry type graph.
The problem of ﬁnding polytopes or maniplexes with a given symmetry type
graph is in general very diﬃcult, as one can note, for example, by looking at
the history of chiral polytopes: although it was back in 1991 [14], when Schulte
and Weiss studied chiral polytopes and classiﬁed their automorphism groups in
terms of generators and relations, it took almost 20years to have a construction
showing that such polytopes existed for all ranks n>3(see [12]).
Very little is know about other particular instances of Question 1. It is
known [2] that every premaniplex with 3 vertices with rank n≥3is the symme-
try type graph of a polytope, and in [13] Pellicer, Potočnik and Toledo construct
2-orbit maniplexes, but it is not known if they are polytopal (i.e. the ﬂag graph
of a polytope).
This paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we give the basic concepts
from the theory of abstract polytopes as well as maniplexes, and formally intro-
duce the concepts of symmetry type graphs and premaniplexes. We also state
a relaxed version of Question 1, that we answer later, in Section 4.1. We start
Section 3 by going over the main tool used in this paper: voltage graphs. Then,
by using them, in Section 3.1 we construct a maniplex Mfrom a premaniplex
Xand a group G(satisfying some conditions). Then Gwill act onMby au-
tomorphisms and the quotient of Mby the action of Gwill beX. This means
thatMwill have symmetry type graph Xif and only if every automorphism
4
ofMis represented by the action of an element of G.
In Section 4.1 we use the construction of Section 3 as well as the results
from [4] to characterize in terms of generators and relations the groups that are
automorphisms groups of a polytope with a given symmetry type graph. We
do so by showing that automorphism groups of polytopes must satisfy certain
“intersection conditions” for some subgroups and cosets, that depend on the
symmetry type graph. In other words, we give an algebraic test for the group G
of Section 3.1 that tells us if the constructed maniplex Mis polytopal or not,
thus translating the problem of ﬁnding polytopes with a given symmetry type
graph to a group-theoretic one. This gives an answer to Problem 1 of [1]. In
Section 4.2 we give the proof to the Main Theorem by constructing a polytope
as a coset geometry from a voltage group. This gives an answer to Problem 2
of [1].
We ﬁnish the paper in Section 5 by using the above result to construct (de-
generated) k-orbitn-polytopes with with Boolean groups (elementary abelian
2-groups) as automorphism group, for all k,n≥3. For this, we deﬁne caterpil-
larsas premaniplexes having exactly one generating three and studying their
coveringsinordertoavoidthepossibleextrasymmetrythatmighthappenwhen
one uses our construction to obtain polytopes from groups.
2 Abstract polytopes and maniplexes
In this section we shall give the basic deﬁnitions and properties of abstract
polytopes and maniplexes, and some relations between them. For more details,
we refer the reader to [4], [11] and [16].
A partially ordered set is said to be ﬂaggedif it has a (unique) least and a
(unique) greatest element and each maximal chain, called a ﬂag, has the same
5
ﬁnite cardinality. As all ﬂags have the same cadrinality, say n+2, ﬂagged posets
naturally admit an order-preserving function, the rank, from the poset to the
set{−1,0,1,...,n}. The rank function allows us to talk about ﬂag-adjacencies:
given two ﬂags ΦandΨof a ﬂagged poset, they are said to be i-adjacent if they
satisfy to diﬀer only in the element of rank i.
An(abstract)n-polytope (also called an (abstract) polytope of rank n) is a
ﬂagged posetPin which the following conditions hold:
•Diamond condition: for each ﬂag ΦofPand eachi∈{0,1,...,n−1},
there exists a unique i-adjacent ﬂag to Φ.
•Strong ﬂag connectedness: for any two ﬂags ΦandΨofP, there exists a
sequence of adjacent ﬂags connecting ΦtoΨ, such that all the ﬂags in the
sequence contain the faces of the intersection Φ∩Ψ.
The elements of rank iin a polytope are called i-faces. Given a ﬂag Φ, we
often denote its i-face as Φi, and by Φiits (unique!) i-adjacent ﬂag. Recur-
sively, ifwis a word on{0,...,n−1}we denote by Φwithe ﬂag (Φw)i. It is
straightforward to see that (Φi)i= Φ, and that Φi
j= Φjif and only if i/negationslash=j.
Given a ﬂagged poset Pone can deﬁne its ﬂag graph as the graphG(P)
whose vertices are the ﬂags of Pand two ﬂags ΦandΨare connected by an
edge of color i∈{0,1,...,n−1}if and only if they are i-adjacent. The ﬂag
graph of an n-polytope is an n-maniplex , that is, an n-regular connected simple
graph with a proper edge coloring with colors {0,...,n−1}such that if iand
jare two colors satisfying that |i−j|>1, then the graph induced by edges of
colorsiandjis a disjoint union of 4-cycles. However, not every maniplex is
the ﬂag graph of a polytope.
While abstract polytopes generalize classical polytopes to combinatorial
structures, maniplexes (introduced by Steve Wilson in 2012 [16]) generalize
ﬂag graphs of a polytope as well as of the ﬂag graphs of maps on surfaces (that
6
is, 2-cellular embeddings of connected graph on a surface). In order to unify our
notation of abstract polytopes and maniplexes, when dealing with maniplexes
we shall call ﬂagsto its vertices and say that two of them are i-adjacent if they
are the vertices of an edge of colour i.
It follows from the deﬁnition of a maniplex that each ﬂag is incident to
exactly one edge of each color. Then, for each i∈{0,1,...,n−1}one can
deﬁnerias the permutation of the set of ﬂags that maps each ﬂag its i-adjecent
one. In other words Φri= Ψif and only if ΦandΨarei-adjacent.
The permutations ri, withi∈{0,1,...,n−1}, are all involutions with no
ﬁxed points and, by connectivity, they generate a group of permutations on the
ﬂags which acts transitively on them. Furthermore, if |i−j|>1thenrirjis
also an involution with no ﬁxed points; thus, riandrjcommute.
Since Φriis the ﬂagi-adjacent to Φ, it is convenient to denote it by Φiand
to follow the same recursive notation as before: Φwi= (Φw)iwherewis a word
on{0,1,...,n−1}.
The group/angbracketleftr0,r1...,rn−1/angbracketrightis called the monodromy orconnection group of
the maniplexM, it shall be denoted by Mon (M)and we shall call each of
its elements a monodromy . Ifwis a word on the alphabet {0,1,...,n−1}
we identify wwith the monodromy x/mapsto→xw, that is ,the word a1a2...akis
identiﬁed with the monodromy ra1ra2...rak.
Amaniplex homomorphism is a graph homomorphism that preserves the
color of the edges. Using the connectedness of maniplexes one can see that
every maniplex homomorphism is determined by the image of one ﬂag and that
they are all surjective. The notions of isomorphism andautomorphism follow
naturally.
As with polytopes, we denote the automorphism group of a maniplex Mby
Γ(M). By deﬁnition, if γ∈Γ(M), then (Φri)γ= (Φi)γ= (Φγ)i= (Φγ)ri, for
7
alli∈{0,1,...,n−1}, implying that ωγ=γωfor allω∈Mon (M).
Note further that, since the action of Mon (M)is transitive, the action of
Γ(M)is free (or semi-regular). Of course, this is true for both polytopes and
maniplexes.
LetMbe ann-maniplex. If I⊂{0,1,...,n−1}, we deﬁneMIas the
subgraph ofMinduced by the edges of colors in I. Ifi∈{0,1,...,n−1}, we
use the symbol ito denote the set {0,1,...,n−1}\{i}, and more generally,
ifK⊂{0,1,...,n−1}, we denote its complement by K. In particularMi
is the subgraph of Mobtained by removing the edges of color i. We will use
this notation also for any graph with a coloring of its edges even if its not a
maniplex.
In [4] Garza-Vargas and Hubard describe how to recover a polytope Pfrom
its ﬂag graph: the elements of rank iofPare the connected components of Mi;
the order is given as follows: given connected components FandGofMiand
Mj, respectively, we set F <Gif and only if i<jandF∩G/negationslash=∅
In [4] it is proved that if Mis any maniplex then P(M)is in fact a poset
(actually, it is a ﬂagged poset).
It is not diﬃcult to see ([4]) that PandP/primeare isomorphic polytopes if and
only if their ﬂag graphs G(P)andG(P/prime)are isomorphic. This fact implies the
following theorem, which can be interpreted as saying that all the information
of the polytopePis encoded in its ﬂag graph.
Theorem 2.1. [4] LetPbe a polytope and let M=G(P)be its ﬂag graph.
ThenPis isomorphic (as a poset) to P(M)andΓ(P) = Γ(M).
Theorem 5.3 of [4] gives a characterization of polytopal maniplexes, that is,
those maniplexes that are isomorphic to the ﬂag graph of some polytope. Such
characterization is given in terms of some path intersection properties of the
maniplexes.
8
Deﬁnition 2.2. LetMbe ann-maniplex. We say that Msatisﬁes the strong
path intersection property (or SPIP) if for every two subsets I,J⊂{0,1,...,n−
1}and for any two ﬂags ΦandΨ, if there is a path Wfrom ΦtoΨusing only
darts of colors in Iand also a path W/primefrom ΦtoΨusing only darts of colors in
J, then there also exists a path W/prime/primefrom ΦtoΨthat uses only darts of colors
inI∩J.
We say thatMsatisﬁes the weak path intersection property (or WPIP) if
for any two ﬂags ΦandΨand for allk,m∈{0,1,...,n−1}, whenever there is
a pathWfrom ΦtoΨwith only darts of color in [0,m] :={0,1,...,m}and a
pathW/primefrom ΦtoΨwithonlydartsofcolorsin [k,n−1] :={k,k+1,...,n−1},
then there is also a path W/prime/primefrom ΦtoΨwith only darts of colors in [k,m] :=
{k,k+ 1,...,m}.
Theorem 2.3. [4] LetMbe a maniplex. Then the following conditions are all
equivalent:
•Mis polytopal.
•Msatisﬁes the SPIP.
•Msatisﬁes the WPIP.
In any of these cases P(M)is a polytope whose ﬂag graph is isomorphic to
M.
2.1 Premaniplexes and symmetry type graphs
Ak-orbit maniplex is one with exactly kﬂag orbits under its automorphism
group. When studying k-orbit maniplexes with k > 1one ﬁnds that it is
convenient to classify them in terms of the local structure of the ﬂags. For this
reason, in [2], Cunningham et al. introduce the concept of symmetry type graph .
9
Given a maniplex Mand a subgroup Gof the automorphism group of M,
thesymmetry type graph of Mwith respect to G, denoted either by T(M,G)
or byM/G, is constructed as follows: The vertex set of T(M,G)is the set of
ﬂag orbits ofMunder the group G, and if ΦandΨarei-adjacent inMwe
draw an edge of color ibetween their orbits. If ΦandΦiare in the same orbit
underG, we draw a semi-edge of color iat the vertex corresponding to that
orbit. Recall that a semi-edge is diﬀerent from a loop in that it consists of only
one dart which is inverse to itself, rather than two darts starting at the same
vertex; less formally, a semi-edge is incident to the vertex once, while a loop is
incident to the vertex two times.
When we speak about the symmetry type graph of M, we mean it with
respect to Γ(M)and we simply write T(M)instead ofT(M,Γ(M)).
IfPis a polytope, the symmetry type graph of P(with respect to G)is
deﬁned as the symmetry type graph (with respect to G) of its ﬂag graph.
IfXis the symmetry type graph of an n-maniplex, then it is a connected
graph in which every vertex is incident to exactly one edge of each color in
{0,1,...,n−1}and it satisﬁes that if |i−j|>1, the paths of length 4 that
alternate between the colors iandjare closed. However, it might not be
a maniplex as it is not necessarily simple. We will call such a graph a n-
premaniplex .
IfXis a premaniplex and i,j∈{0,1,...,n−1}are non-consecutive, the
connected components of the subgraph of Xinduced by the edges of colors i
andjare not necessarily 4-cycles. In fact they can be any quotient of a 4-cycle,
as ilustrated in Figure 1.
Thenotionsof homomorphism, isomorphism, automorphism andmonodromy
groupfrom maniplexes can all be easily extended to premaniplexes as well.
The natural projection p:M→T (M,G)is, of course, a homomorphism

(of premaniplexes).
When studying polytopes (or maniplexes) and their symmetry type graphs
two natural questions occur:
Question 2. Given a premaniplex X, is there a polytope (or maniplex) whose
symmetry type graph is X?
Question 3. Given a premaniplex X, what conditions must a group Gsatisfy
so that there is a polytope (or maniplex) Psuch thatT(P,G)∼=X?
In Section 4.1 we give a complete answer to Question 3. Question 2 remains
as a hard question, as even if we ﬁnd a polytope Pand a group Gsuch that
T(P,G)∼=X, it may still happen that Gis a proper subgroup of Γ(P). How-
ever, in Section 5 we give an inﬁnite family of premaniplexes that are in fact
symmetry type graphs of polytopes.
3 Voltage graphs
The projection p:M→T (M,G)is an example of what is called a regular
covering projection in graph theory (see [5] or [10] for more details). Given a
11
regular covering projection p:/tildewideX→X, one may recover the graph /tildewideXfrom the
graphXusing what is known as a voltage assignment .
Apathin a graph is a ﬁnite sequence of darts W=d1d2...,dksuch that
the dartdi+1starts at the endpoint of the dart di. Thestartpoint of Wis the
starting point of d1(denotedI(d1)), and the endpoint of Wis the endpoint of dk
(denotedT(dk)). Ifxandyare the startpoint and endpoint of W, respectively,
we say that Wgoes fromxtoyand we write this as W:x→y. If the endpoint
and startpoint of a path Ware the same vertex xwe say that Wis aclosed path
based atx. We also consider that for every vertex xthere is an empty closed
path based at x.
If a pathWends at the startpoint of a path V, we may deﬁne the product
WVas their concatenation.
Two pathsWandW/primewith the same startpoint and endpoint are said to be
homotopic if one can transform WintoW/primeby a ﬁnite sequence of the following
operations:
•Inserting two consecutive inverse darts at any point, that is
d1d2...didi+1...dk/mapsto→d1...didd−1di+1...dk,
whereI(d) =T(di);
•Deleting two consecutive inverse darts at any point, that is
d1...didd−1di+1...dk/mapsto→d1d2...didi+1...dk;
In this case we write W∼W/prime.
Itiseasytoseethathomotopyisanequivalencerelationandthatif W∼W/prime
andV∼V/prime, thenWV∼W/primeV/prime. Therefore, we can think of the product of two
homotopy classes of paths. The set of all homotopy classes of paths in a graph
Xwith this operation is called the fundamental groupoid of Xand it is denoted
12
byΠ(X). We will often speak of a "path WinΠ(X)", but the reader should
keep in mind that we are actually referring to its homotopy class.
The subset of Π(X)consisting of all the (homotopy classes of) closed paths
based at a vertex xforms a group known as the fundamental group of X(based
atx)and it is denoted by Πx(X).
Avoltage graph is a pair (X,ξ)whereXis a graph and ξis a groupoid
antimorphism from Π(X)to a group G. In this case we say that ξis avoltage
assignment (on X)and we call Gthevoltage group (of ξ). The element ξ(W)
is called the voltage of W.
Note that a voltage assignment is completely determined by the voltages of
the darts of the graph, as the voltage ξ(W)of a pathW=d1d2...dk−1dkis
simplyξ(dk)ξ(dk−1)...ξ(d1).
Given a voltage graph (X,ξ)with voltage group G, we can construct the
derived graph Xξas follows:
•The vertex set is V×GwhereVis the vertex set of X.
•The dart set is is D×GwhereDis the dart set of X.
•The dart (d,g)starts at the vertex (x,g)and ends at the vertex (x,ξ(d)g).
Thisisanundirectedgraph,astheinverseofthedart (d,g)isthedart (d−1,ξ(d)g).
Given a path Wstarting at a vertex xand given an element gin the voltage
group, there is a unique path /tildewiderWinXξthat starts at (x,g)that projects to W.
The path /tildewiderWis called a lift ofWand it is easy to see that it ends at (x,ξ(W)g)
(for details see [10]).
In our case, we will work with graphs that have a coloring of its edges (and
therefore, darts), so we will deﬁne that the color of the dart (d,g)is the same
as the color of d.
It is known (see [5] or [10]) that if p:/tildewideX→Xis a regular covering, there is
a voltage assignment ξsuch that /tildewideXis isomorphic to Xξ.
13
3.1 Voltage graphs that give maniplexes as derived
graphs
Of course, we want to use voltage graphs to obtain maniplexes (and polytopes).
In this section we shall give necessary and suﬃcient conditions on a voltage
assignment ξon a premaniplex Xso thatXξis a maniplex.
In [2, Section 5] the authors ﬁnd a set of distinguished generators for the
automorphism group of a maniplex Mwith a given symmetry type graph X. It
is easy to see that such distinguished generators can be thought of as voltages
assigned to X(or more precisely to Π(X)) so that the derived graph is M. To
do this, one must choose a spanning tree TonXand assign trivial voltage to
all its darts. If we want to start with a premaniplex X, we need to be careful
with the way we assign voltages so that the derived graph is indeed a maniplex.
LetXbe a premaniplex with fundamental groupoid Π(X), and letξ:
Π(X)→Γbe a voltage assignment, for some group Γ. We want to ﬁnd the
conditions on Γandξthat ensure that Xξis actually a maniplex, but before
doing so, let us assume that there is a spanning tree TofXwith trivial voltage
in all its darts.
First we want Xξto be connected. It is known (see [10]) that in order for
Xξto be connected, ξ(D)must generate Γ, whereDdenotes the set of darts of
D.
Next,Xξmust be a simple graph. Thus, it must not have semi-edges nor
multiple edges. Note that a semi-edge of Xξthat starts at a vertex (x,γ)ends
in(x,ξ(e)γ) = (x,γ), whereeis a semi-edge of X. This implies that if the
voltage of every semi-edge of Xis not trivial, we avoid semi-edges in Xξ. Since
ξis an antimorphism we should have that ξ(e) =ξ(e−1) =ξ(e)−1, implying
that the voltage of a semi-edge must have order two.
To avoid multiple edges, we need to avoid diﬀerent darts with the same
14
initialandterminalvertices; suppose Xξhastwoparalleldarts (d,σ)and(d/prime,τ).
Since both darts start at the same vertex, we have that (I(d),σ) = (I(d/prime),τ),
soI(d) =I(d/prime)andσ=τ. The common end-point of (d,σ)and(d/prime,τ)could
be written as (y,ξ(d)σ)or(z,ξ(d/prime)σ), whereyis the end-point of dandzthe
end-point of d/prime. The fact that these two are the same means that y=zand
ξ(d) =ξ(d/prime). So(d,σ)and(d/prime,σ)are parallel darts in Xξif and only if dandd/prime
are parallel darts in Xwith the same voltage. Thus, Xξhas no parallel darts
if and only if no pair of parallel darts in Xhas equal voltages.
Finally, we want to ensure that if |i−j|>1, the paths of length 4 in Xξ
that alternate colors between iandjare closed. Let /tildewiderWbe one of these paths.
Projecting /tildewiderWtoXwe get a path WinXof length 4 that alternates colors
betweeniandj, and since Xis a premaniplex we know that Wis closed.
SupposeWstarts at a vertex x. Then/tildewiderWgoes from a vertex of the form (x,γ)
to(x,ξ(W)γ). So/tildewiderWis closed if and only if ξ(W)γ=γ, or in other words,
Whas trivial voltage. Summarizing this discussion, we arrive to the following
lemma:
Lemma 3.1. LetXbe a premaniplex and let ξ: Π(X)→Γbe a voltage
assignment with a spanning tree Tof trivial voltage on all its darts. Then Xξ
is a maniplex if and only if
1. The set ξ(D)generates Γ, whereDis the set of darts of X,
2.ξ(d)has order exactly 2 when dis a semi-edge,
3.ξ(d)/negationslash=ξ(d/prime)whendandd/primeare parallel darts, and
4. if|i−j|>1every (closed) path Wof length 4 that alternates between the
colorsiandjhas trivial voltage.
In Section 4 we shall translate the conditions in Lemma 3.1 to relations
and inequalities that the generators of a group Γneed to satisfy to act on a
15
maniplex with given symmetry type graph X. Before doing so (in the next
section), Let us now take a closer look at the consequences of condition 4 of the
above Lemma.
Condition 4 of Lemma 3.1 invites us to introduce a new concept of ho-
motopy: we say that two paths WandW/primearemaniplex-homotopic if we can
transform one into the other by a ﬁnite sequence of inserting or deleting pairs
of inverse darts, as well as switching the colors of two consecutive darts with
non-consecutive colors, that is
d1d2...didi+1...dk/mapsto→d1d2...d/prime
id/prime
i+1...dk,
where|c(di)−c(di+1)|>1, c(d/prime
i) =c(di+1),c(d/prime
i+1) =d(di),I(d/prime
i) =I(di)and
I(d/prime
i+1) =T(d/prime
i). Hence, a voltage assignment ξis well deﬁned when applied
to the maniplex-homotopy class of paths if and only if it satisﬁes Condition
4 of Lemma 3.1. From this point on, whenever we speak about homotopy,
homotopy class, fundamental groupoid, etc. we will be thinking in terms of
maniplex-homotopy.
One could use the group Γ :=/angbracketleftS|R/angbracketrightas the voltage group where Shas
a generator αefor each edge enot in the spanning tree of XandRhas one
elementα2
eper each semi-edge and one element αe4αe3αe2αe1for each path
of length four alternating between two non-consecutive colors. In fact every
voltage group that gives a maniplex should be a quotient of this group, or in
other words Γis the “most general” group we can use as a voltage group to get
a maniplex as the derived graph. We know (see [6]) that X=T(U,G)where
Uis the universal polytope of rank nandGis some group. This means that
there is some voltage assignment ξonXwith voltage group Gsuch thatXξis
isomorphic to the ﬂag graph of U. Because of the universality of Uwe get that
GandΓin fact are the same. In other words, if we use the most general group
as our voltage group we will always get the ﬂag graph of the universal polytope
16
as the derived graph.
4 Intersection properties and coset geome-
tries
In order to prove the Main Theorem, we need to characterize, in terms of
generators and relations, the groups Γthat act by automorphisms on a polytope
Pin such a way that the symmetry type graph T(G(P),Γ)is isomorphic to a
given premaniplex X. We shall do this in order to be able to recover the
polytopePas a coset geometry using the group Γ.
We start with the premaniplex Xand provide it with a voltage assignment
ξ. Recall that if (X,ξ)is a voltage graph with voltage group Γ, thenXξ/Γis
isomorphic to X; conversely, ifM/Γis isomorphic to Xthen there is a voltage
assignment ξonXsuch thatXξis isomorphic toM. Hence, by characterizing
the voltage assignments ξthat satisfy that the derived graph Xξis the ﬂag
graph of a polytope, we determine the conditions that Γmust satisfy to be the
automorphism group of a polytope with symmetry type X.
4.1 Voltage graphs and the path intersection prop-
erty
Wehaveﬁguredouthowtoconstructamaniplexfromapremaniplexviavoltage
assignments. It is then natural to ask: when is the obtained maniplex the ﬂag
graph of a polytope? The answer, as we shall see in this section, is closely
relatedtoTheorem2.3. Infact, translatingTheorem2.3tothesettingofvoltage
assignments will give us conditions that take the form of intersection properties
that certain distinguished subgroups and some left cosets must satisfy. Given
17
two vertices x,yinXand a set of colors I∈{0,1,...,n−1}, let us denote by
Πx,y
I(X)the set of (homotopy classes of) paths from xtoyinXthat only use
darts with colors in the set I. Soξ(Πx,y
I(X))denotes the set of voltages of all
the paths of Xfromxtoywhose edges have colors in I.
Theorem 4.1. LetXbe a premaniplex and let ξ: Π(X)→Γbe a voltage
assignment such that Xξis a maniplex. Then Xξis the ﬂag graph of a polytope
if and only if
ξ(Πx,y
I(X))∩ξ(Πx,y
J(X)) =ξ(Πx,y
I∩J(X)), (1)
for allI,J⊂{0,...,n−1}and all vertices x,yinX.
ProofStartbyassumingthat Xξistheﬂaggraphofapolytope. Let xandybe
vertices ofXand letI,J⊂{0,1,...,n−1}. Consider two paths, W∈Πx,y
I(X)
andW/prime∈Πx,y
J(X), withthesamevoltage, say α∈Γ. Whenlifting WandW/primein
Xξ, they lift to paths /tildewiderWand/tildewiderW/prime, respectively, that go from (x,1)to(y,α)(here
1 is the identity element of Γ) and satisfying that /tildewiderWuses edges with colors in I
while/tildewiderW/primeuses edges with colors in J. In fact, one would deﬁne /tildewiderWand/tildewiderW/primeas the
paths that start at (x,1)and follow the same sequence of colors as WandW/prime
respectively. ByTheorem2.3 XξsatisﬁestheSPIP,whichimpliesthatthereisa
path/tildewiderW/prime/primefrom (x,1)to(y,α)that uses only colors in I∩J. Then, its projection
W/prime/prime:=p(/tildewiderW/prime/prime)is a path in Xthat goes from xtoythat uses only colors in I∩J
and has voltage α. This proves that ξ(Πx,y
I(X))∩ξ(Πx,y
J(X))⊂ξ(Πx,y
I∩J(X)).
Since the other contention is given, equality (1) must hold.
Now let us assume that equality (1) holds for all I,J⊂{0,1,...,n−1}
and all vertices xandy. Let/tildewiderWand/tildewiderW/primebe paths in Xξfrom a vertex (x,γ)
to a vertex (y,τ). LetIandJbe the sets of colors of darts of /tildewiderWand/tildewiderW/prime,
respectively, and let W:=p(/tildewiderW)andW/prime:=p(/tildewiderW/prime)be the projections of the
paths toX. Then, both WandW/primego fromxtoy, andWis a path with
18
colors inI, whileW/primeis a path with colors in J, that is,W∈Πx,y
I(X)and
W/prime∈Πx,y
J(X). Furthermore, since /tildewiderWand/tildewiderW/primestart at (x,γ)and ﬁnish at
(y,τ), they both have voltage α:=τγ−1. By hypothesis, there exists a path
W/prime/prime∈Πx,y
I∩J(X)that also has voltage α. ThenW/prime/primehas a unique lift /tildewiderW/prime/primewhich
is a path in Xξfrom (x,γ)to(y,τ)and it uses darts of colors in I∩J. This
proves that Xξsatisﬁes the SPIP and therefore, by Theorem 2.3, it is the ﬂag
graph of a polytope.
Note that when x=ythe setξ(Πx,y
I(X)) :=ξ(Πx
I(X))is a group, since it is
the image of a group under a groupoid antimorphism. Actually, we shall ﬁnd a
set of distinguished generators for the group ξ(Πx
I(X))in a similar way as the
distinguished generators of the automorphism group of a polytope are found in
[2]. Recall that XIis the subgraph of Xinduced by the edges with colors in
Iand thatXI(x)is the connected component of XIcontaining the vertex x.
To ﬁnd the distinguished generators of ξ(Πx
I(X)), ﬁx a spanning tree Tx
Ifor
XI(x). For each dart dinXI(x)but not inTx
Iwe get a cycle Cdof the form
WdVwhereWis the unique path contained in Tx
Ifromxto the initial vertex
ofd, andVis the unique path contained in Tx
Ifrom the terminal vertex of dto
x. Then, the set{Cd}, wheredruns among the darts in XI(x)not inTx
I, is a
generating set for Πx
I(X). This imples that {ξ(Cd)}, wheredruns among the
darts ofXI(x)not inTx
I, is a set of generators for ξ(Πx
I(X)).
Sinceξis a voltage assignment, we might consider only one dart dfor each
edge. By denoting by Wythe unique path contained in Tx
Ifromxtoy, we can
see that Πx,y
I(X) = Πx
I(X)Wy(that is, a path from xtoycan be written as a
closed path starting and ﬁnishing at x, concatenated with Wy), which implies
thatξ(Πx,y
I(X)) =ξ(Wy)ξ(Πx
I(X)). Therefore, all the intersection properties
can be given in terms of left cosets of the groups ξ(Πx
I), whose generators we
already know.

Theorem 4.1 gives an intersection property for each pair of vertices (x,y)
and each two sets of colors I,J⊂{0,1,...,n−1}. If we prove an intersection
property for the pair (x,y), by taking the inverse on both sides we get the
corresponding property for the pair (y,x), so we can consider only unordered
pairs{x,y}, and this reduces the number of intersection properties to verify by
a factor of 2. Still, the total number of intersection properties is quadratic on
the number of vertices and exponential on the number of colors. This number
getstoobigtooquickly; however, manyofthesepropertiesareredundant, either
becausetheyaretrueforanygroup(forexample, theintersectionofagroupand
one of its subgroups is the smaller subgroup) or because they are a consequence
of other intersection properties.
Fortunately we may reduce the number of intersection properties to check by
following the same proof but using the weakpath intersection property instead
of the strong one. Doing this we get the following reﬁnement of the previous
theorem.
Theorem 4.2. Given a premaniplex Xand a voltage assignment ξsuch that
Xξis a maniplex, Xξis the ﬂag graph of a polytope if and only if
ξ(Πx,y
[0,m](X))∩ξ(Πx,y
[k,n−1](X)) =ξ(Πx,y
[k,m](X)), (2)
for allk,m∈{0,...,n−1}and allx,y∈F.
With Theorem 4.2 the number of intersection properties to check is now
quadratic on the number of vertices and also quadratic on the rank. We can
still reﬁne this theorem a little more with the following observations:
•The casesk= 0andm=n−1say that the intersection of the whole
voltage group with some subset is the subset itself, so they are trivially
true for every voltage assignment.
20
•In Theorem 4.2 one has to consider the case when k > m. In such case,
ξ(Πx,y
[k,m](X))is the trivial group when x=yand the empty set when
x/negationslash=y. However, if the intersection property holds for k=m+ 1, that
is, ifξ(Πx,y
[0,m](X))∩ξ(Πx,y
[m+1,n−1](X)) =ξ(Πx,y
∅(X)), then it also holds for
k>m +1. So one may only verify the intersection property for k≤m+1.
•Ifyandy/primeare in the same connected component of X[k,m]and (2) is
satisﬁed for the pair (x,y), then it is also satisﬁed for the pair (x,y/prime). To
see this, let Wbe a path from ytoy/primewith colors in [k,m]and notice that
Πx,y/prime
I(X) = Πx,y
I(X)WwheneverIcontains [k,m]. By taking voltages we
get thatξ(Πx,y/prime
I(X)) =ξ(W)ξ(Πx,y
I(X)). This means thatwe can get the
intersection property for the pair (x,y/prime)by multiplying the one for pair
(x,y)byξ(W)on the left. So for each pair of numbers (k,m)we only need
to verify one intersection property for each pair of connected components
ofX[k,m].
Taking the previous observations into consideration, the maximum amount
of necessary intersection properties to check is v(v+ 1)/2/summationtextn−2
m=0(m+ 1) =
v(v+ 1)n(n−1)/4. But to reach this bound we need for every vertex to be in a
diﬀerentconnectedcomponentof X[k,m]foreverypair (k,m)with 0<k≤m+1,
which is only possible when v= 1. In other words, this bound is not tight for
symmetry type graphs with more than one vertex.
4.2 Constructing a polytope from the voltage group
We have seen how to recover a polytope from its ﬂag graph (see Theorem 2.3)
and whenXξis the ﬂag graph of a polytope for a given premaniplex Xand
a voltage assignment ξ(see Theorem 4.2). By concatenating the construction
ofXξfromXandξ, and the construction of a polytope PfromXξwe get a
21
construction of a polytope from Xandξ. In this section, we translate this to
give a construction only in terms of subgroups of Γand their cosets. This will
give the proof of the Main Theorem.
Letfbe a choice function on the connected subgraphs of X, that is, a
function that assigns a base vertex to each such subgraph. Let Cbe a connected
component of XIfor someI⊂{0,1,...,n−1}and letx=f(C). LetC:=
(Xξ)I(x,1), that is, the connected component of (Xξ)Icontaining (x,1). Thus,
if(x,γ)∈C, then there is a path /tildewiderWfrom (x,1)to(x,γ)which uses only colors
inI, which implies that its projection is a closed path WinΠx
I(X)with voltage
γ. This means that when considering the action of ΓonXξ, the stabilizer of C
coincides with ξ(Πx
I(X)). If we now consider a coset ξ(Πx
I(X))σ, this would be
the set of elements of Γthat mapCto(Xξ)I(x,σ).
We know that the i-faces of the polytope that has Xξas its ﬂag graph
correspond to the connected components of (Xξ)i. This makes natural the
following construction:
GivenXandξsatisfying Theorem 4.2 and a choice function fon the con-
nected subgraphs of X, we construct a partially ordered set P(X,ξ)with a
rank function whose elements of rank iare the right cosets of groups of the type
ξ(Πx
i(X))where
x∈{f(C)|Cis a connected component of Xi}.
We have to consider these groups as formal copies, that is, if xandx/primeare
on diﬀerent connected components we consider ξ(Πx
i(X))to be diﬀerent than
ξ(Πx/prime
i(X)), even if, as groups, they might be equal. Likewise, if j/negationslash=ibut
ξ(Πx
i(X))coincides with ξ(Πx/prime
j(X))we consider them to be diﬀerent in P(X,ξ).
Wecouldformalizethisbysayingthattheelementsofrank iinP(X,ξ)arepairs
(C,ξ(Πx
iγ))withCa connected component of Xi,x=f(C)andγ∈Γ, but
sincexandialready appear in the notation, we may assume that ξ(Πx
i(X))γ
22
stands for the pair (Xi(x),ξ(Πx
i(X))γ).
Now we shall deﬁne the order on P(X,ξ)as follows. First, for all i∈
{0,1,...,n−1}and every vertex yinXwe look at the connected component
Xi(y)and ﬁx a path going from its base vertex x=f(Xi(y))toy. We call this
pathWy
iand we denote its voltage by αy
i:=ξ(Wy
i).
Deﬁnition 4.3 (Order inP(X,ξ)).Given 0≤i < j≤n−1, letCbe a
connected component of XiandC/primebe a connected component of Xj, and letx
andx/primebe their respective base ﬂags. Given γ,γ/prime∈Γ, we say that
ξ(Πx
i(X))γ <ξ (Πx/prime
j(X))γ/primeif and only if αy
iξ(Πx
i(X))γ∩αy
jξ(Πx/prime
j(X))γ/prime/negationslash=∅,
for somey∈C∩C/prime.
Theorem 4.4. LetXbe a premaniplex and ξ: Π(X)→Γa voltage assignment
satisfying Theorem 4.2. Let
P(X,ξ) :={ξ(Πx(C))τ:Cis a connected component of Xi,x=f(C),τ∈Γ},
together with the order given in Deﬁnition 4.3. Then P(X,ξ)is a polytope in
which Γacts with symmetry type graph X.
ProofLet us denoteP(Xξ)asPandP(X,ξ)asQ. Note that Theorem 4.2
implies thatQis a polytope, and we want to show that Pis also a polytope
(such thatP/Γ∼=X).
By the discussion in Section 3.1, T(P,Γ)∼=X, since, by construction of Xξ,
we have that Xξ/Γ∼=X. So in order to settle the theorem it is enough to ﬁnd
a poset isomorphism ϕ:Q→Psuch that it commutes with the action of Γ,
that is, such that /tildewideCσϕ =/tildewideCϕσfor all faces /tildewideCinQand allσ∈Γ.
Let/tildewideCbe a face ofP. Hence, /tildewideCis a connected component of Xξ
ifor some
colori. LetC:=p(/tildewideC)and letx:=f(C). This implies that /tildewideChas a ﬂag of
23
the type (x,γ)for someγ∈Γ. Let/tildewideKbe the connected component of Xξ
ithat
contains (x,1). Then, the set of elements of Γthat map /tildewideKto/tildewideCisξ(Πx
i(X))γ.
We want to identify /tildewideCwith this coset, so we deﬁne /tildewideCϕ:=ξ(Πx
i(X))γ. Note
thatϕ:Q→P is well deﬁned, since if (x,γ/prime)is in/tildewideCthenγ/primeγ−1stabilizes
/tildewideK, implying that γ/primeγ−1∈ξ(Πx
i(X)). We want to prove that ϕis a poset
isomorphism and that it commutes with Γ.
Let us show ﬁrst that ϕcommutes with the action of Γ. Let/tildewideCbe a face
inXξand letσ∈Γ. By the deﬁnition of ϕwe know that /tildewideCϕ=ξ(Πx
i(X))γ
whereiis the rank of /tildewideC,x=f(p(/tildewideC))andγ∈Γis any element such that
(x,γ)∈/tildewideC. On the other hand (/tildewideCσ)ϕ=ξ(Πx/prime
i(X))γ/primewherex/prime=f(p(/tildewideCσ))
and(x/prime,γ/prime)∈/tildewideCσ. Also note that since /tildewideCand/tildewideCσare in the same orbit, then
p(/tildewideC) =p(/tildewideCσ), and thusx=x/prime. Furthermore, the ﬂag (x,γσ ) = (x,γ)σis in
/tildewideCσ. This proves that (/tildewideCσ)ϕ=ξ(Πx
i(X))γσ= (/tildewideCϕ)σ.
Now let us prove that ϕis an isomorphism of posets. Let /tildewideCand/tildewideC/primebe
incident faces ofPof ranksiandj, respectively, with i<j(therefore, /tildewideC </tildewideC/prime).
Hence, there is a ﬂag (y,τ)in/tildewideC∩/tildewideC/prime, which in turn implies that its ﬁrst entry,
y, must be in C∩C/primewhereC=p(/tildewideC)andC/prime=p(/tildewideC/prime).
Note that the path Wy
iis contained in CwhileWy
jis contained in C/prime. Then,
these paths have lifts /tildewiderWy
iand/tildewiderWy
jrespectively, that go from (x,(αy
i)−1τ)and
(x/prime,(αy
j)−1τ), respectively, to (y,τ). Observe that /tildewiderWy
iis contained in /tildewideCand
/tildewiderWy
jis contained in /tildewideC/prime. Thus, (αy
i)−1τ∈Πx
i(X)γand(αy
j)−1τ∈Πx/prime
j(X)γ/prime.
Therefore
τ∈αy
iξ(Πx
i(X))γ∩αy
jξ(Πx/prime
j(X))γ/prime=αy
i(/tildewideCϕ)∩αy
j(/tildewideC/primeϕ);
but this means that /tildewideCϕ</tildewideC/primeϕinQ.
Conversely, suppose that /tildewideCϕ </tildewideC/primeϕinQ. We want to show that /tildewideC </tildewideC/prime
inXξ. Let us write /tildewideCϕ=ξ(Πx
i(X))γ, whereiis the rank of /tildewideC,x:=f(p(/tildewideC))
andγis an element of the voltage group such that (x,γ)∈/tildewideC. Similarly, we
24
write/tildewideC/primeϕ=ξ(Πx/prime
j(X))γ/prime, wherejis the rank of /tildewideC/prime,x:=f(p(/tildewideC/prime))andγ/primeis an
element of the voltage group such that (x/prime,γ/prime)∈/tildewideC/prime.
By hypothesis αy
iξ(Πx
i(X))γandαy
jξ(Πx/prime
j(X))γ/primehave non-empty intersec-
tion for some y∈C∩C/prime. Letτbe an element in such intersection. Then
(αy
i)−1τ∈ξ(Πx
i(X))γ. This implies that (x,(αy
i)−1τ)is in the same connected
component of (Xξ)ias(x,γ), that is (x,(αy
i)−1τ)∈/tildewideC. But at the same time,
there is a lift of Wy
ithat connects (x,(αy
j)−1τ)with (y,τ), and since Wy
idoes
not use the color i, its lift is contained in /tildewideC, which proves that (y,τ)∈/tildewideC.
Similarly, the fact that (αy
j)−1τ∈ξ(Πx/prime
j(X))γimplies that (y,τ)∈/tildewideC/prime. Thus,
we have proved that /tildewideC∩/tildewideC/primeis not empty, or in other words /tildewideC </tildewideC/primeinP.
Therefore,ϕis an isomorphism and the theorem follows.
5 Example: Caterpillars
Ifonewantstobuildpolytopesfrompremaniplexesinthewaywehavedescribed
in this paper, it is natural to start with inﬁnite families of premaniplexes. One
could, ofcourse, thenstartwithpremaniplexeswithaﬁxednumber kofvertices.
For example, one may want to construct 2-orbit polytopes (see [9]). If, on the
other hand, we do not want to limit the number of vertices of the premaniplexes
in the family a ﬁrst step could be to consider trees. However, since semi-
edges are considered as cycles, there are no premaniplexes whose underlying
graph (without colours) is a tree. Thus, we study the closest thing to them:
premaniplexes that are trees with an unlimited number of semi-edges. Hence,
we deﬁne a caterpillar as a premaniplex in which every cycle is a semi-edge. In
other words, a caterpillar is a premaniplex Xwith a unique spanning tree.
In particular, a caterpillar does not have pairs of parallel links (edges joining
diﬀerent vertices). If there are three links incident to one vertex, at least two of
25
x0x1x2x3xkc1c2c3Figure 2: A ﬁnite caterpillar.
them must have colors diﬀering by more than 1, which would imply that there is
a 4-cycle. This implies that caterpillars consist in fact of a single path P(which
we will call the underlying path of X) and lots of semi-edges. Of course, the
colors of two consecutive edges on the path must diﬀer by exactly one, otherwise
there would be a 4-cycle. We note here that the term caterpillar has been used
in the graph theory literature for a very similar but slightly diﬀerent concept.
Throughout this section, unless otherwise stated, Xwill denote a ﬁnite
caterpillar (that is, one with a ﬁnite number of vertices) with underlying path
P, and its vertices will be labeled by x0,x1,...,xk, ordered as they are visited
byP. Furthermore, we denote by (xi,j)the dart of color jatxiand bycithe
color of the link connecting xi−1andxi.
5.1 Caterpillar coverings
We want to construct polytopes from caterpillars. As often when constructing
maniplexes and polytopes via voltage assignments from a premaniplex X, the
derived maniplex might not have Xas the symmetry type graph with respect
to the full automorphism group. However, the actual symmetry type graph is a
quotient of X. For this reason, in this section we study quotients of caterpillars.
Given a caterpillar, let us call an endpoint a vertex incident to just one link
(that is, an endpoint of the underlying path). Note that a caterpillar is ﬁnite
if and only if it has exactly two endpoints. Every symmetry of the caterpillar
must map endpoints to endpoints. If a caterpillar is ﬁnite there is at most
26
one non-trivial symmetry and its action on the vertices x0,x1,...,xkis given
byxj/mapsto→xk−j. We call a ﬁnite caterpillar symmetric if it has a non-trivial
symmetry.
Awordwin{0,1,...,n−1}is simply a ﬁnite sequence w=a1a2...at, with
ai∈{0,1,...,n−1}for eachi= 1,2,...,t. Theinverseof a wordwis the
wordw−1that has the same colors as wbut written in reverse order. That is, if
w=a1a2...atthenw−1=atat−1...a 1. A word is said to be reducedif it has
no occurrence of the same color twice in a row; in other words, w=a1a2...at
is reduced if and only if ai+1/negationslash=aifor alli= 1,2,...,t−1. We shall work
with reduced words from now on. A word w=a1a2...atis apalindrome if
ai=at+1−ifor alli∈{1,2,...,t}. A palindrome word of even length can be
written asvv−1for some word vand cannot be a reduced word. A palindrome
word of odd length can always be written as w=vav−1for some color aand
some word v.
Given a segment [x,y]in a caterpillar, its underlying word is the word w
consisting of the colors of the links in the path that goes from xtoy. When we
speakofthe underlying word ofacaterpillar Xwearereferringtotheunderlying
word of its underlying path in a ﬁxed orientation. Hence, we say that a segment
[x,y]is apalindrome if its underlying word vis a palindrome.
Proposition 5.1. LetXbe a ﬁnite caterpillar and let Ybe a premaniplex not
isomorphic to Xsuch that there is a premaniplex homomorphism h:X→Y.
ThenYis a caterpillar. Moreover, if Yhas at least 2 vertices and S=c1c2...ck
is the underlying word of X, then there is some r<ksuch thatw=c1c2...cr
is the underlying word of Yand one of the following statements is true:

{c1+ 1,c1−1}such thatS=wa1w−1b1wa2w−1b2...bt−1watw−1.

In any case, if i≡jmod 2r+ 2thenh(xi) =h(xj). Also ifi≡−j−
1 mod 2r+ 2thenh(xi) =h(xj).
Before proving Proposition 5.1 let us remark that it simply means that the
quotients of a caterpillar Xare those caterpillars Ysuch thatXcan be “folded”
intoY. We illustrate this concept in Figure 3: the semi-edges are not drawn
and the names of the vertices have been omitted, but the idea is that Xmust
be “folded” into “layers” of r+ 1vertices and then each vertex will be projected
to the vertex on Yin the same horizontal coordinate. The layer /lscriptconsists of the
verticesxiwhere/floorleftBig

=/lscript(⌊x⌋denotes the integer part of x). Even layers go
from left to right, while odd layers go from right to left, hence the underlying
word of even layers is w=c1c2...crwhile the underlying word of odd layers is
w−1=crcr−1...c 1.
28
Now let us proceed with the proof.
Proof of Proposition 5.1 Let us consider the equivalence relation ∼honX
given byx∼hyif and only if h(x) =h(y). Recall that by the deﬁnition
of a premaniplex homomorphism x∼hyimplies that xm∼hymfor every
monodromy m. Therefore Yis isomorphic to X/∼h.
We already know that all premaniplex homomorphisms are surjective (see
Section 2). By hypothesis his not an isomorphism, which implies it cannot be
injective. Let xandybe two diﬀerent vertices on Xsuch thatx∼hy. Let
x0,x1,...,xkbe the sequence of vertices in the underlying path of X. There
is a monodromy msuch thatxm=x0, and sox0∼hymandymis diﬀerent
thanx0. Now letqbe the minimum positive number such that xq∼hx0. We
know thatqexists because x0∼hym. Note that if q= 1we would have that
xi
0∼hx0for alli, which would imply that the same is true for x1and in turn
also forx2=xc2
1and so on. This would mean that all the vertices of Xare
equivalent, meaning that Yhas only one vertex and the proposition follows. So
we may assume that q>1.
We know that xq−1=xcqqis equivalent xcq
0. Ifcq/negationslash=c1, we would have that
xcq
0=x0. This would imply that xq−1is equivalent to x0, contradicting the
minimality of q. So we have proven that cq=c1.
Now note that if for some /lscriptwe have that x/lscript∼x1, thenxc1
/lscript∼xc1
1=x0. In
particular this tells us that for /lscript < q−1,x/lscriptcannot be equivalent to x1. Now
we can use the same argument we used to prove that cq=c1to prove that
cq−1=c2. Analogously we can prove that c3=cq−2,c4=cq−3and so on. In
other words, [x0,xq]is a palindrome. Since for all i,ciandci+1are diﬀerent,
thenqis odd, say q= 2r+ 1. Letvbe the underlying word of the segment
[x0,xq]. Thenvmay be written as v=wcr+1w−1for some word w=c1c2...cr.
Let us calla1:=cr+1and note that a1∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}.
29
For alli= 0,1,...,k, let us denote by /hatwideithe residue of dividing iby2r+ 2.
We will prove by induction on ithatxi∼hx/hatwideifor alli= 0,1,...,kand that
ci=c/hatwideiwheniis not divisible by r+1,ci∈{c1+1,c1−1}ifiis an odd multiple
ofr+ 1andci={cr+ 1,cr−1}wheniis an even multiple of r+ 1.
Let our induction hypothesis be that x/lscript∼hx/hatwide/lscriptfor all/lscript<i, and thatc/lscript=c/hatwide/lscript
if/lscriptis not divisible by r+ 1.
Let us start with the case when i≡0 mod 2r+ 2. In this case we want to
prove thatxi∼hx/hatwideiand thatci∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}. By our induction hypothesis
we know that xi−1∼hx2r+1∼hx0andci−1=c2r+1=c1. In particular
ci∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}. This implies that xi=xci
i−1∼hxci
0=x0=x/hatwidei(since
ci/negationslash=c1). Thusisatisﬁes our claim.
Now let us proceed with the case when iis an odd multiple of r+ 1, that is
/hatwidei=r+1. Inthiscasewewanttoprovethat xi∼hx/hatwideiandthatci∈{cr+1,cr−1}.
Our induction hypothesis tells us that xi−1∼hxrand thatci−1=cr. Hence
ci∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}. Note that one of the colors in {cr+ 1,cr−1}is actually
cr+1, while the other is the color of a semi-edge incident to xr. Sincexr+1∼hxr
we have that xi=xci
i−1∼hxcir∼hxr∼hxr+1=x/hatwidei. Thusisatisﬁes our claim.
Finally let us prove our claim for the case when iis not divisible by r+ 1.
Our induction hypothesis tells us that xi−1∼hx/hatwidei−1. Note that /hatwidei=/hatwidei−1 + 1.
Sinceiis not a multiple of r+ 1we know that x/hatwidei=xc/hatwidei
/hatwidei−1is not equivalent to
x/hatwidei−1. This implies that xc/hatwidei
i−1is not equivalent to xi−1, and since it is adjacent to
xi−1it must be equal to either xiorxi−2. Ifi≡1 modr+ 1then by induction
hypothesis xi−1∼hx0, but recall that x0∼hx2r+1=xqby deﬁnition, and by
induction hypothesis xi−2∼hx/hatwidei−2=x2r+1. This means that xi−2∼hxi−1, so
xc/hatwidei
i−1must bexi, implying that ci=c/hatwidei. Ifi/negationslash≡1 modr+ 1then our induction
hypothesis tells us that ci−1=c/hatwidei−1/negationslash=c/hatwidei, and since xi−2=xci−1
i−1=xc/hatwidei−1
i−1, so
the only possibility is that xc/hatwidei
i−1=xi, implying that ci=c/hatwideiand thatxi∼hx/hatwidei.
30
Thus,isatisﬁesourclaim. Notethatwehavealsoproventhatif iisnotdivisible
byr+ 1thenxi−1cannot be an endpoint of X.
We have proved that xi∼hx/hatwideifor alli= 0,1,...,k. This implies automati-
cally that if i≡jmod 2r+2thenxi∼hxj. Moreover, if i≡−j−1 mod 2r+2,
then/hatwidei= 2r+ 1−/hatwidej. Now since vis a palindrome, we know that x/lscript∼hx2r+1−/lscript
for all/lscript= 0,1,..., 2r+ 1, in particular x/hatwidei=x2r+1−/hatwidej∼hx/hatwidej. This, together
with the fact that xi∼hx/hatwideiandxj∼hx/hatwidej, implies that xi∼hxj.
We have already proved that S=wa1w−1b1wa2w−1...and it ends after
an occurrence of worw−1. To end the prove note that since his surjective
we already know exactly what premaniplex Yis: It is a caterpillar with vertex
sequenceh(x0),h(x1),...,h (xr). Infact,for i= 1,...,r−1andj= 0,1,...n−1
we know that h(xi)is diﬀerent from h(xi)j=h(xj
i)if and only if j∈{ci−1,ci};
and ifi= 0(resp.r) thenh(xi)is diﬀerent from h(xi)jif and only if j=c1
(resp.cr).
If we look closely at the proof of Proposition 5.1 we notice that we have not
actually used the fact that Xis ﬁnite, but only the fact that it has at least one
endpoint. So the proposition may be generalized as follows:
Proposition 5.2. LetXbe a caterpillar with at least one endpoint and let Y
be a premaniplex such that there is a premaniplex homomorphism (or covering)
h:X→Y. ThenYis a caterpillar. Moreover, if S=c1c2...is the color
sequence of Xstarting at its endpoint, there is some rsuch thatw=c1c2...cr
is the underlying word of Yand there exist colors a1,a2,...∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}
andb1,b2...∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}such thatS=wa1w−1b1wa2w−1b2.... IfXis
ﬁnite it ends after an occurrence of either worw−1. Ifi≡jmod 2r+ 2then
h(xi) =h(xj). Also ifi≡−jmod 2r+ 1and/floorleftBig

mod 2then
h(xi) =h(xj).
31
Let us look now at the degenerate cases. If Yis only one vertex we can think
that the previous theorems still hold but with wbeing the empty word, and
sincec1andcrdo not exist, we get rid of the restrictions ai∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}
andbi∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}. In Figure 3 Xwould have only one vertex and no
links per layer; essentially Xwould be “standing up” instead of being folded. If
Yis isomorphic to XthenS=wand we do not have any aiorbi. In Figure 3
Xwould have only one layer.
If one would try to prove an analogous result as Proposition 5.2 for cater-
pillars with no ends, the only additional case to consider would be that when
Yis not a caterpillar but a premaniplex consisting of a cycle with underlying
wordwand all the edges not in the cycle are semiedges. In this case Xwould
have the underlying inﬁnite word ···www···.
5.2 Caterpillars as STG of polytopes
Given a caterpillar X, we want to assign voltages to the semi-edges of Xin
order to get the ﬂag graph of a polytope as the derived maniplex. To this
end, we note that in caterpillars the conditions of Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 can be
simpliﬁed, as stated in the following lemma:
Lemma 5.3. LetXbe a caterpillar and let ξ: Π(X)→Γbe a voltage assign-
ment such that all the darts in the underlying path of Xhave trivial voltage.
Then the following statements are equivalent.
1.Xξis polytopal.
2. For every vertex xinxand all sets I,J⊂{0,1,...,n−1}the equation
ξ(Πx
I(X))∩ξ(Πx
J(X)) =ξ(Πx
I∩J(X))
holds.
32
3. For every vertex xinXand allk,m∈{0,1,...,n−1}the equation
ξ(Πx
[0,m](X))∩ξ(Πx
[k,n−1](X)) =ξ(Πx
[k,m](X))
holds.
ProofTo prove this we have to see that for every set of colors I⊂{0,1,...,n−
1}the setξ(Πx,y
I(X))is eitherξ(Πx
I(X))or empty, depending on whether or
not the segment of Pthat goes from xtoy(which we will denote [x,y]) uses
or not only colors in I. In fact if [x,y]uses only colors in Ithen
ξ(Πx,y
I(X)) =ξ(Πx
I(X)[x,y]) =ξ([x,y])ξ(Πx
I(X)) = 1·ξ(Πx
I(X)) =ξ(Πx
I(X)).
Note also that ξ(Πx,y
I(X))∩ξ(Πx,y
J(X))is empty if and only if one of the
factors is empty. These observations together with Theorems 4.1 prove the
equivalence between conditions 1 and 2, and with Theorem 4.2 we prove the
equivalence between conditions 1 and 3, thus proving the lemma.
Recall that a Boolean group (or anelementary abelian 2-group) is a group in
which every non-trivial element has order exactly 2. Thus, all Boolean groups
are abelian, and ﬁnitely generated Boolean groups are isomorphic to a direct
product of cyclic groups of order 2.
Proposition5.4. Every caterpillar is the quotient of the ﬂag graph of a polytope
by a Boolean group.
ProofLetXbe a caterpillar. We shall ﬁnd a Boolean group Band a voltage
assignment ξ: Π(X)→Bsuch thatXξis polytopal in the following way.
First assign trivial voltage to all links of Pand a diﬀerent independent
voltage to each semi-edge incident to x0. We shall give voltage assignments to
the semi-edges (xi,j), recursively on i. If|j−ci|>1we assign the same voltage
33
to(xi,j)as we did to (xi−1,j). On the ohter hand, if |j−ci|= 1, we assign a
new element as the voltage (xi,j)independent from all the voltages of previous
darts.
Let us call the resulting voltage group Band denote this voltage assignment
byξ. By Lemma 3.1, Xξis a maniplex.
Note further that ξsatisﬁes that if i∈{1,2,...,k};r,s∈{0,1,...,n−1}
and(xi−1,r)and(xi,s)are semi-edges, then ξ(xi,s) =ξ(xi−1,r)if and only if
r=sand|r−ci|/negationslash= 1. It also satisﬁes that if i</lscript<j and(xi,r)and(xj,r)
are semi-edges such that ξ(xi,r) =ξ(xj,r) =γ, then (x/lscript,r)is also a semi-edge
andξ(x/lscript,r) =γ.
We claim that the second statement of Lemma 5.3 is satisﬁed, and hence,
Xξis the ﬂag graph of a polytope. To show that this is the case, start by
noticing that ξ(Πx
I)is the group generated by the voltages of the semi-edges on
the component XI(x).
GivenI,J⊆{0,1,...,n−1}, suppose that for some vertex xthere is a
semi-edgeeinXI(x)and a semi-edge e/primeinXJ(x)withξ(e) =ξ(e/prime) =γfor
someγ∈Γ. Ife=e/primethene∈XI∩J(x). Ife/negationslash=e/primethen we have that for some
i,j∈{0,...,k−1}and somer∈{0,...,n−1}occurs that e= (xi,r)and
e/prime= (xj,r); in particular r∈I∩J. Ifx∈[xi,xj]then, as previously observed,
ξ(x,r) =γ(see Figure 4) and since (x,r)∈XI∩J(x)this meansγis a generator
ofξ(Πx
I∩J). Ifx /∈[xi,xj]consider without loss of generality that xiis further
away from xthanxj, in other words, that xj∈[xi,x](see Figure 5). Then
[xi,x]uses only colors in Iand[xj,x]⊂[xi,x]uses only colors in J. Then since
[xj,x]⊂[xi,x]we know that [xj,x]uses only colors in I∩J, meaning that
e/prime∈XI∩J(x)and since its voltage is γ, this shows that γis always a generator
ofξ(Πx
I∩J). Therefore, we have shown that if γis a generator of both ξ(Πx
I(X))
andξ(Πx
J(X)), then it is also a generator of ξ(Πx
I∩J(X)).

Now letσ∈ξ(Πx
I(X))∩ξ(Πx
J(X))be arbitrary. Since the group Bis
Boolean,σmay be written as σ=γ1γ2...γswhere the elements γ1,γ2,...,γs
are diﬀerent generators of B, and this decomposition is unique up to reordering
of the factors. Since σ∈ξ(Πx
I(X)), and because the voltage of a semi-edge is
always a generator, each γiis also inξ(Πx
I(X)), and sinceσ∈ξ(Πx
J(X))eachγi
is also inξ(Πx
J(X)). But, this implies that each γiis inξ(Πx
I∩J(X)), implying
thatσ∈ξ(Πx
I∩J(X)). Therefore, ξ(Πx
I)∩ξ(Πx
J) =ξ(Πx
I∩J).
Proposition 5.4 is still true for inﬁnite caterpillars. Even if our algorithmic
way of assigning voltages may not be doable, the voltage assignment is still well
deﬁned as a quotient of the Boolean group with one generator assigned to each
semi-edge.
Note that Proposition 5.4 says that every caterpillar Xis a symmetry type
graph of a polytope Pwith respect to some group B≤Γ(P). However need
not happen that Xis the symmetry type graph of Pwith respect to the full
35
automorphism group. That is, Xξmight have “extra” symmetry. Thus, we
would want to investigate what could be the symmetry type of Xξwith respect
to its full automorphism group.
LetXbe a ﬁnite caterpillar and let ξ: Π(X)→Bbe the voltage assignment
constructed in the proof of Proposition 5.4. If Xis symmetric, its non-trivial
symmetry induces an automorphism of Bwhich is just a reordering of the
generators, moreover, if the generators are given the natural order, it induces
the reverse order on the generators. Using [10, Theorem 7.1], we get that this
symmetry induces a symmetry of the derived maniplex, so in this case the
original caterpillar is not the symmetry type of the derived polytope. But we
will see in Theorem 5.5 that if this is not the case we can almost be certain that
the caterpillar is in fact the symmetry type graph of the derived polytope by
its full automorphism group. In this case, by “almost” we mean that if this is
not the case, the caterpillar must have a very speciﬁc structure.
Theorem 5.5. LetXbe a ﬁnite caterpillar of length kand rankn. LetS=
c1c2...ckbe the underlying word of X. Then at least one of the following
statements is true:
1.Xis symmetric.
2.Xis the STG of a polytope with a Boolean automorphism group.
3.c1is in{1,n−2}and there exist r∈{1,2,...,k−1}, anda1,a2,...,at∈
{0,1,...,n−1}wheret= (k+1)/(2r+2), such thatS=wa1w−1bwa2w−1b...bwatw−1
wherew=c1c2...crandb= 0ifc1= 1andb=n−1ifc1=n−2.
4. There exist r∈{1,2,...,k−1}anda,b∈{0,n−1}such that
S=waw−1bwaw−1b...bwaw−1bw,
wherew=c1c2...cr. Also (c1,b),(cr,a)∈{(1,0),(n−2,n−1)}.
36
ProofSuppose that Xis not symmetric and that it is not the STG of a poly-
tope with a Boolean automorphism group.
Consider the voltage assignment ξ: Π(X)→Bpreviously discussed. We
say that two vertices xandyofXare equivalent ( x∼y) if there exist (or
equivalently, for all) σ,τ∈Bsuch that the ﬂags (x,σ)and(y,τ)ofXξare in
the same orbit under the action of the automorphism group of Xξ. Then∼
is an equivalence relation preserved by i-adjacency, that is x∼y⇒xi∼yi.
Moreover, the natural function h:X→X/∼is a premaniplex homomorphism,
so by Proposition 5.1 there exists some rsuch that the Scan be written as
wa1w−1b1wa2w−1b2...ending after an occurrence of either worw−1, where
w=c1c2...cr,ai∈{cr+ 1,cr−1}andbi∈{c1+ 1,c1−1}(see Figure 3).
Note that since Xis not symmetric nor the STG of Xξwith respect to B,
at leastb1exists. Let j∈{0,1...,k−1}be a number such that the segment
[x0,xj+1]has the underlying word wa1w−1b1wa2w−1b2...w−1bifor somei. We
know in particular that bidiﬀers from c1in exactly 1. We want to prove that
(c1,bi)∈{(1,0),(n−2,n−1)}. We will assume this is not the case and arrive
to a contradiction.
Letqbe theothercolor that diﬀers from biin exactly 1 (that is q= 2bi−c1).
Since (c1,bi)/negationslash= (1,0),(n−2,n−1)we know that q∈{0,1,...,n−1}, and thus
is the color of some edges of X. So there are semi-edges e,e/primeincident to x0of
colorsqandbirespectively. Let α:=ξ(e)andβ:=ξ(e/prime). The voltage of the
closed path ee/primeee/primeis(βα)2= 1becauseBis Boolean. This means that its lift,
(the path of length 4 that starts at (x,1)inXξand alternates colors between
qandbi) must be closed.
By Theorem 5.1, we know that cj+1=c1/negationslash=q, so we know that the darts
(xj+1,q)and(xj,q)are semi-edges. Let κ:=ξ(xj,q)andλ=ξ(xj+1,q). The
path of length 4 that alternates colors between randbiand starts at xjis

closed, and its voltage is λκ. Note that since |q−bi|= 1the construction of
ξtells us that ξ(xj,q)/negationslash=ξ(xj+1,q), that isλ/negationslash=κ, which implies λκ/negationslash= 1. This
means that the path of length 4 in Xξstarting at (xj,1)and alternating colors
betweenrandbiis not closed (it ends at (xj,λκ)).
We see that the path of length 4 in Xξstarting at (xj,1)and alternating col-
ors between randcj+1is not closed, but the one starting at (x0,1)is. This con-
tradictsthefactthat (xj,1)and(x0,1)areonthesameorbit. Thecontradiction
comes from the fact that there are edges of color q= 2bi−c1∈{0,1,...,n−1},
so to avoid this we must have that (c1,bi)∈{(1,0),(n−2,n−1)}. Sincec1is
ﬁxed, every bimust be the same.
If the underlying word of Xends after an occurrence of wwe may look at
Xin the other direction. Then the previous result tells us that every aiis equal
to someaand that (cr,a)∈{(1,0),(n−2,n−1)}.
Remark 5.6.If the third or fourth condition is the one holding in Theorem 5.5,
the actual STG of Xξmight be the ﬁnite caterpillar with underlying word w.
By doing exactly the same proof, we obtain the following analogous result
for inﬁnite caterpillars with one end-point (this would look like a ray or half-
straight line):
Theorem 5.7. LetXbe an inﬁnite caterpillar with one end-point. Let Sbe the
sequence of colors of the underlying path of Xstarting at its end-point. Then
38
one of the following statements is true:
1.Xis the STG of a polytope with a Boolean automorphism group.
2. There exist some number rand colorsb,a1,a2,...,at∈{0,1,...,n−1}
such thatS=wa1w−1bwa2w−1bwa3w−1...wherew=c1c2...crand
(c1,b)∈{(1,0),(n−2,n−1)}.
Remark 5.8.If the second condition is the one holding, the actual STG of Xξ
might be the ﬁnite caterpillar with underlying word w.
Ifk≥3, it is easy to construct a caterpillar of length k−1(that is, with k
vertices and k−1links) that does not satisfy properties (1),(3)and(4)(simply
letc1= 0and then avoid the color 0for every other ci). Hence, we get the
following corollary:
Corollary 5.9. For everyn,k≥3, there is an abstract n-polytope with Boolean
automorphism group that has kﬂag orbits.
