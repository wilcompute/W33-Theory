What are abstract polytopes?
Anabstract n-polytope Qis a poset having some of the key structural
properties of the face lattice of a convex n-polytope, although Q
•need not be a lattice
•need not be ﬁnite
•need not have a familiar geometric realization
The abstract 3-polytopes include all convex polyhedra, face-to-f ace
tessellations and many less familiar structures. But
you can safely think of a ﬁnite 3-polytope as a map on a compact surface .
Do we want details?

By transitivity, pick any
base ﬂag = Φ [white]
Then
0-adjacent ﬂag =: Φ0[pink]

Regular polytopes and string C-groups
Schulte (1982) showed that the abstract regular n-polytopes Pcorrespond
exactly to the string C-groups of rank n (which we often study in their
place).
The Correspondence Theorem .
Part 1. IfPis a regular n-polytope, then Γ( P) =/an}bracketle{tρ0,...,ρn−1/an}bracketri}htis a
string C-group .
Part 2. Conversely, if Γ = /an}bracketle{tρ0,...,ρn−1/an}bracketri}htis a string C-group, then we can
reconstruct an n-polytope P(Γ) (in a natural way as a
coset geometry on Γ).
Furthermore, Γ( P(Γ))≃Γ andP(Γ(P))≃ P.

Recap: what is a string C-group?
Means: having ﬁxed a base ﬂag Φ in P, for 0≤j≤n−1 there is a
unique automorphism ρj∈Γ(P) mapping Φ to the j-adjacent ﬂag Φj.
These involutions generate Γ( P) and satisfy the relations implicit in some
string (Coxeter) diagram, like
•p1•p2•...•pn−1•,
and perhaps other relations, so long as this intersection condition
continues to hold:
/an}bracketle{tρk:k∈I/an}bracketri}ht∩/an}bracketle{tρk:k∈J/an}bracketri}ht=/an}bracketle{tρk:k∈I∩J/an}bracketri}ht
(for allI,J⊆ {0,...,n−1}).
Notice that Pthen has Schl¨ aﬂi type {p1,...,pn−1}.

Example 2. A modern look at a a classical object
(from Wikipedia)Thesmall stellated dodecahedron {5
2,5}is a
Euclidean realization of the map
M={5,5|3}. This quotient of the inﬁnite
tessellation {5,5}ofH2is determined by
specifying that ‘1st holes’ be triangular, i.e.
Γ(M) =/an}bracketle{tρ0,ρ1,ρ2/an}bracketri}ht, where
ρ2
0=ρ2
0=ρ2
0= (ρ0ρ1)5= (ρ1ρ2)5
= (ρ0ρ2)2=(ρ0ρ1ρ2ρ1)3= 1.
(The ‘extra’ hole relation is red. You can see
the ’hole’, which is really an anti-hole.)
In contrast, the great icosahedron {3,5
2}
is isomorphic to the convex regular
icosahedron {3,5}.

more:uniformpolytopes inductively have uniform facets, again with Γ( Q)
vertex-transitive, taking polygons to be uniform to start.

Alternating Semiregular Polytopes
Deﬁnition An abstract semiregular n-polytope Sisalternating if it has two
(necessarily compatible) types of regular facets, say PandQ, appearing in
alternating fashion around each ( n−3)-face.
Example 4.Thecuboctahedron is an alternating
semiregular 3-polytope. Here k= 2 each of
triangles P={3}and squares Q={4}
alternate around each 0-face = vertex.
Each rectangular vertex-ﬁgure is a
‘geometrically alternating’ polygon, but is
abstractly regular of course.
Atruncated tetrahedron , for example, is
semiregular but not alternating.

Thing 1 and Thing 2 – build an alternating polytope
You are given – unlimited copies of regular polyhedra PandQ
having matching facets
Your task – Start with a single P. Attach a copy of Qto each
P-facet, then a copy of Pto each remaining
‘exposed’ facet of a Q, and so on in alternating
fashion with the
Edge Rule k– close up around each edge after kP’s andkQ’s.
•Can this be done?
•Is the resulting ‘complex’ Sa 4–polytope?
•If so, what is the symmetry group Aut(S)?

mutually non–isomorphic minimal regular covers.
There is such a ﬁnite, minimal regular cover Ppfor each prime p. Each of

isomorphic) facets, there exists a semiregular ( n+1)-polytope Swith
inﬁnitely many facets of type PandQ, occurring alternately around each

Some almost ﬁnal words on monodromy ...
The structure of regular covers Rof a general polytope Qhas a lot to do
with the monodromy group Mon(Q).
Mon(Q) is a natural permutation group on the ﬂag set of Q; this action
commutes with the action of automorphisms on ﬂags.
Mon(Q) is a string group generated by involutions, nearly a string
C-group. But for the tomotope these generators fail the intersecti on
condition.
The fall out : covering and likely other combinatorial questions are
complicated.

disjoint union of two polyhedra

So when is Mon(Q) a string C-group?
Some results below may be well-known, others new:
Mon(Q) is a string C-group if
•Qis any polyhedron ( d= 3, regardless of symmetry); or
•Qis regular of any rank (in which case Γ( Q)≃Mon(Q)); or
•all facets of Qare regular quotients of one particular regular facet (or
dually); or
•Qhas any mixture of regular facets together with ﬂag-transitive
vertex-ﬁgures (or dually).
•Thus: ifQis any simplicial (or simple) convex polytope, then
Mon(Q) is a string C-group.
Example . The cyclic convex 4-polytope Qon 6 vertices thereby has
a regular cover of Schl¨ aﬂi type {3,3,12};Mon(Q) is a string C-group
of order 26·37.
