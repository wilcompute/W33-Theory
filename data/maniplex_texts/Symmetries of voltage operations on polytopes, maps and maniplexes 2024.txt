Voltage operations extend traditional geometric and combinato-
rial operations (such as medial, truncation, prism, and pyramid
over a polytope) to operations on maniplexes, maps, polytopes,
and hypertopes. In classical operations, the symmetries of the
original object remain in the resulting one, but sometimes ad-
ditional symmetries are created; the same situation arises with
voltage operations. We characterise the automorphisms of the
new object that are derived from the original one and use this
to bound the number of flag orbits (under the action of its
automorphism group) of the new object in terms of the original
one. The conditions under which the automorphism group of the
original object is the same as the automorphism group of the
resulting object are given. We also look at the cases where there
is additional symmetry which can be accurately described due
to the symmetries of the operation itself.

1. Introduction
Two of the more well-known operations on maps and polyhedra are the medial and the
truncation. These are two of the Wythoffian operations ([3, Section 5.7]), which are defined on
convex regular polyhedra as the convex hull of the orbit of a point in the intersection of certain
mirror reflections from the original polyhedron. These operations can be generalised to maps and

abstract polyhedra, even if they are not regular (see [11,18]). They induce local transformations
on the original polyhedron: the new faces always correspond to either the faces or the vertex-
figures of the original. In the medial, the new vertices correspond to the old edges, and the new
edges correspond to the oldcorners(vertex-face incident pairs). In the truncation, the new vertices
correspond to the old arcs and the new edges correspond to the old edges combined with the old
corners.
These operations have been well-understood in different contexts, such as convex or skeletal
polyhedra and maps on surfaces, both combinatorially and geometrically (see, for example, [3,18]).
In particular, the symmetries of the medial or truncation of a map or polytope have been studied.
The automorphisms of a polyhedron Pinduce automorphisms of its medial and truncated poly-
hedra. These two polyhedra may have additional automorphisms that are not derived from the
automorphisms ofP(see [18]). The extra symmetry of the medial of a polyhedron Pis simple
to explain: it is present if and only ifPis self-dual. On the other hand, the extra symmetry
of the truncation is more difficult to identify. Nevertheless, it is possible to find a family of
polyhedra whose symmetries are the same as those of the original polyhedron. This family consists
of polyhedra whose flags cannot be coloured with two colours in such a way that 2-adjacent flags
have different colours while 0- and 1- adjacent flags have the same colour. However, even if the
flags of a polyhedron can be coloured in this way, it does not necessarily mean that the truncation
has extra symmetry.
Although dissimilar, these two conditions have something in common: they enable us to identify
polyhedra whose medial and/or truncation do not possess any additional symmetries. We can
deduce the number of orbits and their local arrangement in the medial and truncation of a
polyhedron Pif we are aware of the number of orbits and their local configuration under the group
of automorphisms ofP. More precisely, we can find a polyhedron Psuch that ifTis thesymmetry
type graphofP(the quotient of the flag graph ofPby its automorphism group), then Med(T) and
Tr(T) are the symmetry type graphs of Med(P) and Tr(P), respectively.
Voltage operations, first introduced in [10], are a generalisation of classic geometric and topo-
logical operations on maps and polytopes (e.g. Wythoffian constructions, snub, dual, Petrie-dual,
products of polytopes as described in [6], and many more). These operations may be useful in
addressing one of the fundamental questions of the theory of symmetric polytopes, namely, is every
premaniplex the symmetry type graph of a polytope?, as will be discussed later.
Similar to the medial and the truncation, when we apply a voltage operation to a map or
polytope, we usually obtain a new map or polytope with the same automorphism group, but with
an increased number of flags. Furthermore, [10, Theorem 5.1] states that the symmetry type graph
of a map or polytope that has undergone a voltage operation can be expressed in terms of the
symmetry type graph of the original object.
However, there is a caveat: just as with the medial and truncation, the resulting object may
have more symmetries than the original one. The symmetry type graph of the resulting object with
respect to the original group of automorphisms is revealed by [10, Theorem 5.1]; however, it does
not provide information about the symmetry type graph with respect to the full group (if it is larger).
Generally, the actual symmetry type graph is a quotient of the one we get from the theorem, and
the answer is exact only when there are no additional symmetries.
The paper is organised as follows. Section2gives a brief introduction to the concepts used
throughout the paper. Section3recalls the definitions and base properties of voltage operations
given in [10]. Section4, we characterise the automorphisms of a resulting object that come from
automorphisms from the original object, while in Section5we explore when we can ensure
that the automorphism group of the original object coincides with that of the resulting one. This
exploration is done with F-actions, which are also introduced in Section5. Section6investigates
which symmetries of the operation always lift and which ones lift for specific cases. Finally, in
Section7we make some concluding remarks.
2. Basic notions
We start by providing some of the definitions, basic notions, and results that we use throughout
the paper. Many of these notions are treated in our previous paper [10]; we refer the reader to this

This paper deals with voltage operations, which implies we shall deal with voltage graphs. Thus,
we use a very general definition of graph: agraphis a 4-tuple X=(V(X),D(X),I,(·)−1) where
V=V(X) is a non-empty set whose elements are called vertices,D=D(X) is a set whose elements
are called darts,I:D→Vis a function, and (·)−1:D→Dis an involution. The vertex I(d) is called
thestarting point of d, while T(d):=I(d−1) is theterminal pointofd. The dart d−1is theinverse of
d. AnedgeofXis a set{d,d−1}and we denote the set of edges ofXbyE(X). Asemi-edgeis a dart
dthat is its own inverse (thus, a semi-edge is a fixed point of (·)−1)). If the dart dis a semi-edge,
we abuse notation and refer to the edge{d}as a semi-edge as well.
Apathin a graph Xis a finite sequence of darts W=d1d2. . .dkwhere the terminal point of
diis the starting point ofdi+1fori∈ {1, . . . ,k−1}. The starting point of Wisu=I(d1), while
theterminal point of Wisv=T(dk). In this case we say that W goes from u tov(symbolically
W:u→v). IfW:u→ufor some vertex uwe say that it isclosedand based at u. If a path is not
closed, we say that it isopen.
Apremaniplex of rank nor simply n-premaniplexis a graph Xwhose edges (and therefore, darts)
are coloured with elements of the set{0,1, . . . ,n−1}in such a way that every vertex is the starting
point of exactly one dart of each colour, and ifi,j∈{0, . . . ,n−1}are such that|i−j|⩾2, then
the alternating paths of length 4 with colours i,jare closed. We shall refer to the vertices of a
premaniplex asflags. We often abuse notation and useXboth for a premaniplex and for its set of
flags and usex∈Xto say that xis a flag ofX. A connected premaniplex with no parallel edges
and no semi-edges is called amaniplex.
Maniplexes generalise the flag-graph of maps (as 2-cellular embeddings of graphs) and geometric
and abstract polytopes (in the sense of [16]). Given a map or a polytope P, one may define its flag-
graph X=X(P) as the edge-coloured graph whose vertices are the flags ofP, and thei-edges
are between i-adjacent flags. It is straightforward to see that these flag-graphs are maniplexes.
Moreover, thei-faces ofPare in correspondence with the connected components Xi, resulting by
removing all thei-edges ofX. The incidence between thei-faces ofPis given by the non-empty
intersection of the corresponding connected components. Even though a maniplex is not always the
flag-graph of a polytope (see [5]), whenever we start with a polytope we shall abuse notation and
refer to the polytope and the maniplex (its flag-graph) as the same object.
Given a flag x∈Xand a colour i∈ {0,1, . . . ,n−1},ixdenotes the unique dart of colour ithat
starts atx. The terminal point ofixis denoted byxi, and it is called thei-adjacent flag of x.
The universal rank-n Coxeter groupwith string diagram is the group Cn=⟨r0, . . .rn−1⟩defined
by the following relations:
r2
i=εfor alli∈ {0, . . . ,n−1},
(rirj)2=εif|i−j|⩾2.(2.1)
When the rank is clear from the context, or irrelevant for our arguments, we omit thenofCn, and
denote it only byC. Since most of our work in this paper is based on that of [10], it is worth noticing
that the group Cnis denoted by Mon(U) in [10], where Udenotes theuniversal maniplex of rank n.
Eq. (2.1)implies that, for any n-premaniplex X, the family of mappings ri:x↦ →xi(i∈
{0, . . . ,n−1}) defines an action of the group Cnon the flags ofX. This action is transitive if and
only ifXis connected. The monodromy group(often also called theconnection group) ofXis the
permutation group induced by this action. Naturally, we denote this group by Mon(X) (see [8,11]).
IfW:x→x′is a path inXwhose darts have colours i1,i2, . . . ,ik(in that order), we write Was
wx, where w=ik. . .i2i1. We may naturally associate the element ω=rik. . .ri2ri1∈Cto the word
w. Letw1andw2be two words on{0,1, . . . ,n−1}and letω1andω2be the respective elements
ofCassociated to those words in this way. Note that the relations inCnimply that two different
words w1=ik. . .i2i1andw2=jℓ. . .j2j1might induce the same monodromy (ω1=ω2). We say
that the pathsw1x1andw2x2arehomotopicifx1=x2andω1=ω2. It is easy to see that homotopy
is an equivalence relation. We denote byωxthe homotopy class of the pathwx. Note that any path
in the homotopy classωxgoes from xtoωx.
If a path W1ends at the starting point of another path W2, these paths can be concatenated
to get a new path W1W2. This operation is well defined when we do it with homotopy classes:
3
I. Hubard, E. Mochán and A. Montero European Journal of Combinatorics 126 (2025) 104132
in fact (ω1x)(ω2(ω1x))=ω1ω2x. The set of homotopy classes of paths in a premaniplex Xwith the
concatenation as (partial) operation forms a groupoid Π(X), called the fundamental groupoid ofX.
The subset of closed paths based at a flag x, denoted byΠx(X), forms a group and it is called the
fundamental group ofXbased at x.
Given two n-premaniplexes X1andX2, a(premaniplex) homomorphismfromX1toX2is a function
that preserves i-adjacencies, fori∈ {0, . . . ,n−1}. A surjective homomorphism is called acovering.
If there is a covering fromX1toX2we say thatX1covers X2, and thatX2is aquotientofX1. It is
easy to see that ifX2is connected, any homomorphism fromX1toX2is a covering.
A bijective homomorphism is called anisomorphism, and an isomorphism fromXto itself is
called anautomorphism. The set of all the automorphisms ofXforms theautomorphism groupof
Xand it is denoted byΓ(X). It is straightforward to see that automorphisms and monodromies
commute. Moreover, every permutation of the flags ofXthat commutes with every monodromy is
an automorphism.
IfΓ(X) has exactly korbits on the set of flags ofX, we say thatXis ak-orbitpremaniplex.
Given a premaniplex Xand a group Γ⩽Γ(X), we define X/Γin the following way: the flags
are the orbits {xΓ:x∈V(X)}and fori∈ {0, . . . ,n−1}(xΓ)i=(xi)Γ. Since (xi)γ=(xγ)ifor every
γ∈Γ(X), these adjacencies are well-defined. It is straightforward thatX/Γis ann-premaniplex
and that the mapping x↦ →xΓis a covering fromXtoX/Γ. The quotient X/Γis thesymmetry
type graph ofXwith respect toΓ(see [4]). Further, we refer toX/Γ(X) simply as thesymmetry
type graph ofX.
3. Voltage operations
In [10], we define a voltage operation for maniplexes (maps and polytopes) and a voltage
operator. This section revisits such definitions as well as some useful results of these concepts.
For the rest of this paper, if a path Wstarts at a vertex xand follows the colour sequence w, which
itself defines a monodromy ω, we will abuse notation and useW,wxandωxinterchangeably. In
other words, we will always think of paths up to homotopy.
Avoltage assignmenton a premaniplex Yis a function ξ:Π(Y)→Gwith the property that
ξ(W1W2)=ξ(W2)ξ(W1) for any two paths W1,W2such that the product W1W2exists. We are
implicitly asking that ifWand W′are homotopic paths, thenξ(W)=ξ(W′), so that our notation
abuse is still valid. This is equivalent to asking thatξ(d)=ξ(d−1) for every dart dand thatξ(W)=1
whenever Wis a path of length 4 with alternating non-consecutive colours. The element ξ(W)∈G
is called the voltage of W. Note that ifW=d1d1. . .dkthenξ(W)=ξ(dk)· · ·ξ(d2)ξ(d1), so the
voltage of a path is determined by the voltages of its darts. Therefore, we often just define voltages
by assigning an element ξ(d)∈Gto each dart din such a way thatξ(d−1)=(ξ(d))−1andξ(W)=1
whenever Wis a path of length 4 with alternating non-consecutive colours. Graphically, this is
illustrated by writing the voltage next to an edge with an orientation that indicates which dart has
the written voltage. If the voltage is an involution, no orientation is needed. Voltage assignments
can be defined for graphs in general (see [7]).
LetXbe ann-premaniplex and letYbe anm-premaniplex. Consider a voltage assignment
η:Π(Y)→Cn. We define them-premaniplex X⋊ηYin the following way: the flags ofX⋊ηY
are those in the setX×Yand, for each i∈ {0,1, . . . ,m}, there is an edge of colour ifrom (x,y) to (
η(iy)x,riy)
; that is
(x,y)i=(
η(iy)x,riy)
.
We call the pair (Y, η) avoltage operator(or an(n,m)-voltage operatorif we want to emphasise
the ranks), and the mapping X↦ →X⋊ηY, that turns n-premaniplexes into m-premaniplexes is the
corresponding voltage operation(or (n,m)-voltage operation).
There are plenty of known operations that can be described as voltage operations. These include
Wythoffian constructions, the prism and pyramid over a polytope or maniplex, the snub operation
on a map, the orientable double cover (of a non-orientable polytope or maniplex), and many more
(see [10, Section 4]).
4
I. Hubard, E. Mochán and A. Montero European Journal of Combinatorics 126 (2025) 104132
An important property of voltage operations is that they preserve the symmetries of the
premaniplex we apply them to. Furthermore, ifXis a premaniplex, Γ⩽Γ(X) and (Y, η) a voltage
operator, then (X⋊ηY)/Γ∼=(X/Γ)⋊ηY(see [10, Theorem 5.1]). In fact this property characterises
voltage operations ([10, Theorem 7.3]).
However one must be careful: some operations, like the snub, seem to only preserve some
of the symmetries of the original object (e.g. the rotations). The reason is that when seen as
voltage operations, some operations might give, as a result, a premaniplex with many connected
components, and the ‘‘missing’’ symmetries appear as isomorphisms between those components.
For example, when seeing the snub as a voltage operator (Y, η) (as in [10, Section 4]) for every
orientable mapM, the mapM⋊ηYconsists of a left snub ofMand a disjoint right snub ofM;
and ifMadmits an automorphism sending a flag to an adjacent one (e.g. ifMis regular), it appears
as an isomorphism between these two copies.
While some results work for all voltage operations, others work only for those operations that
preserve connectivity, that is, those where X⋊ηYis connected whenever Xis connected. The
following result characterises such operations.
Proposition 3.1([10, Corollary 3.9]).An(n,m)-voltage operator(Y, η)preserves connectivity if and
only ifYis connected andη(Πy0(Y))=Cnfor some (or equivalently, for all) y0∈Y.
It is possible that different voltage assignments onYgive rise to the same voltage operation. In
this case, we say that the corresponding voltage operators areequivalent(the formal definition has
some additional nuances, see [10, Proposition 7.2] for details). Using known results from voltage
assignments on graphs, one can show that any voltage operator is equivalent to one where Yhas
a spanning tree Twhere all its darts have trivial voltage (i.e.ξ(d)=1 for every dart dinT).
Remark 3.2.Unless otherwise stated, we shall assume that (Y, η) has a spanning tree with trivial
voltage.
4. Characterising automorphisms induced byX
In [10], we showed that each automorphism ofXcan be regarded as an automorphism of
X⋊ηY. More precisely, we showed that every automorphism γ∈Γ(X), induces an automorphism
γ∈Γ(X⋊ηY) by (x,y)γ=(xγ ,y). That is, the automorphisms ofXact on theX-coordinate
ofX⋊ηY, and fix theY-coordinate. On the other hand, in [10, Theorem 5.1] we showed that the
quotient (X⋊ηY)/Γ(X) is isomorphic to (X/Γ(X))⋊ηY; that is, that the symmetry type graph of
X⋊ηYwith respect toΓ(X) isT⋊ηY, where Tis the symmetry type graph ofX. If it happens that
Γ(X⋊ηY)=Γ(X), this implies that the symmetry type graph ofX⋊ηYis precisely T⋊ηY. Thus,
under this hypothesis, ifXis ak-orbit premaniplex, thenX⋊ηYis ak|Y|-orbit one. Unfortunately
requiring thatΓ(X⋊ηY)=Γ(X) seems to be a rather strong hypothesis.
In this section we revisit the automorphisms ofX⋊ηYthat come from symmetries ofX, we also
give a characterisation of them and use these results to bound the number of flag-orbits ofX⋊ηY
whenever (Y, η) is a connectivity-preserving voltage operator. Of course, not all automorphisms of
X⋊ηYneed to be of this type. In Section5.2and Section6we shall study automorphisms ofX⋊ηY
that are not induced by automorphisms ofX(in the sense discussed above).
Lemma 4.1. LetXbe a connected premaniplex and let(Y, η)be a voltage operator that preserves
connectivity. Ifγ∈Γ(X⋊ηY)fixes theY-coordinate of every(x,y)∈X⋊ηY, thenγcan be regarded
as an automorphism ofX.
Proof.Since γfixes theY-coordinate, while (maybe) moving theX-coordinate, andXis connected,
we can write theX-coordinate of the image of (x,y) under γas a monodromy that depends on both
xand yacting onx. Thus, we may define θ:X⋊ηY→Csuch that (x,y)γ=(θ(x,y)x,y). To show
thatγ∈Γ(X) we first show that fory,y′∈Y,θ(x,y)x=θ(x,y′)x. Given y,y′∈Y, letω∈Cbe such
that y′=ωyandη(ωy)=1 (it exists since, byProposition  3.1,Yis connected, and byRemark  3.2
there is a spanning tree of trivial voltage). Then,
5
I. Hubard, E. Mochán and A. Montero European Journal of Combinatorics 126 (2025) 104132
(θ(x,y′)x,y′)=(x,y′)γ=(x, ωy)γ=(η(ωy)x, ωy)γ=(ω(x,y))γ
=ω((x,y)γ)=ω(θ(x,y)x,y)=(η(ωy)θ(x,y)x, ωy)
=(θ(x,y)x,y′).
Hence the action ofθonxdoes not depend on theY-coordinate ofX⋊ηY, and we may denote it
asθ(x).
Letωbe a monodromy. Using the fact thatγis an automorphism ofX⋊ηYwe get that, on one
hand:
(ω(x,y))γ=(η(ωy)x, ωy)γ=(θ(η(ωy)x)η(ωy)x, ωy),
and on the other:
(ω(x,y))γ=ω((x,y)γ)=ω(θ(x)x,y)=(η(ωy)θ(x)x, ωy).
Therefore:
θ(η(ωy)x)η(ωy)x=η(ωy)θ(x)x. (4.1)
Now, abusing notation, we define the action ofγonXasxγ:=θ(x)x; we need to show thatγ
acts as an automorphism ofX.
Since (Y, η) preserves connectivity, for each i∈ {0, . . . ,n−1}there is some closed path
ωiy∈Πy(Y) such thatη(ωiy)=ri(Proposition  3.1). Therefore,
(rix)γ=(η(ωiy)x)γ
=θ(η(ωiy)x)η(ωiy)x
=η(ωiy)θ(x)x (because of(4.1))
=riθ(x)x
=ri(xγ).
This shows thatγacts onXas an automorphism. □
Lemma  4.1says that those automorphisms ofX⋊ηYthat always preserve theY-coordinate are
automorphisms ofX. The following result shows that it is enough to see that the automorphism
preserves theY-coordinate of a single flag.
Proposition 4.2. LetXbe a connected premaniplex and(Y, η)be a voltage operator that preserves
connectivity. Letγ∈Γ(X⋊ηY). If there exists(x0,y0)∈X⋊ηYsuch that(x0,y0)γ=(x1,y0)for
some x1∈X, thenγmay be regarded as an automorphism ofX.
Proof.Let (x0,y0)γ=(x1,y0) and let (x,y) be any flag ofX⋊ηY. We want to show thatγfixes
theY-coordinate of (x,y) and useLemma  4.1to conclude the proof.
Since X⋊ηYis connected by hypothesis, there is some ω∈Cmsuch that (x,y)=ω(x0,y0) and
in particular y=ωy0. Then,
(x,y)γ=(ω(x0,y0))γ
=ω((x0,y0)γ)
=ω(x1,y0)
=(η(ωy0)x1, ωy0)
=(η(ωy0)x1,y).
This proves thatγpreserves theY-coordinate of every flag ofX⋊ηY. Therefore,Lemma  4.1tells
us thatγmay be regarded as an automorphism ofX.□

Whenever the graph Yis finite, the above result helps us to bound the number of flag orbits
(under the action of the full automorphism group) ofX⋊ηY. The bound is in terms of the number
of flag orbits ofX, the cardinality ofYand the index [Γ(X⋊ηY):Γ(X)]. More precisely:
Proposition 4.3. LetXbe a k-orbit premaniplex and let(Y, η)be a voltage operator where Yis a
finite premaniplex. LetΓ(X)⩽Γ⩽Γ(X⋊ηY). The following hold:
(i) the number of flag-orbits ofΓonX⋊ηYis
k|Y|
[Γ:Γ(X)];
(ii) if(Y, η)preserves connectivity, then1⩽[Γ:Γ(X)]⩽|Y|;
(iii) in particular, if(Y, η)preserves connectivity, and[Γ:Γ(X)] =ℓthenX⋊ηYis ak|Y|
tℓ-orbit
premaniplex, where t is an integer satisfying1⩽t⩽|Y|
ℓ.
Proof.For simplicity let∆denote the group Γ(X). Consider the setO= {(x,y)∆:(x,y)∈X⋊ηY}
of∆-orbits ofX⋊ηY. Notice that
{(x,y)∆:(x,y)∈X⋊ηY} = {(x∆,y):(x,y)∈X⋊ηY},
which implies that|O| =k|Y|.
Now observe that every ∆-orbit ofX⋊ηYis contained in exactly oneΓ-orbit ofX⋊ηY. Moreover,
ifTis a set of left coset representatives of∆inΓthen eachΓ-orbit (x,y)Γcan be partitioned as
(x,y)Γ=⋃
α∈T(x,y)α∆.
That is, eachΓ-orbit ofX⋊ηYcontains exactly t= [Γ:∆]∆-orbits. Therefore the number of
Γ-orbits ofX⋊ηYis|O|
t=k|Y|
t. This proves Item(i). To prove Item(ii)just recall that if (x1,y1)
and (x2,y2) are both in the same Γ-orbit and satisfy that y1=y2, then they are actually in the
same ∆-orbit (seeProposition  4.2).It follows that if two∆-orbits (x1,y2)∆, (x2,y2)∆are contained
in the same Γ-orbit and satisfy that y1=y2, then (x1,y1)∆=(x2,y2)∆. Therefore, the number
of∆-orbits contained in the same Γ-orbit is bounded by|Y|but we just saw that this number is
[Γ:∆]. Thus 1⩽[Γ:∆]⩽|Y|.
Of course Item(i)holds for the group Γ(X⋊ηY), which implies that the number of orbits of
X⋊ηYis
k|Y|
[Γ(X⋊ηY):∆]=k|Y|
[Γ(X⋊ηY):Γ][Γ:∆]=k|Y|
[Γ(X⋊ηY):Γ]ℓ.
Now, because of Item(ii), the number t= [Γ(X⋊ηY):Γ]satisfies that
tℓ= [Γ(X⋊ηY):Γ][Γ:∆] = [Γ(X⋊ηY):∆]⩽|Y|,
which completes the proof of Item(iii).□
Proposition  4.3generalises [18, Proposition 4.3], that says that the number of orbits of the
truncation of ak-orbit mapMis either k, 3k/2 or 3k. Here we present a few other examples (see [10,
Section 4] for details on how to see these operations as voltage operations).
Example 4.4.IfPis ak-orbit n-polytope, the number of orbits of the pyramid overPis (n+2)k/t
where 1⩽t⩽n+2.
Example 4.5.IfPis ak-orbit n-polytope, the group Γ(X)×C2acts by automorphisms on the prism
overX(more details inTheorem  6.1). Item(iii)ofProposition  4.3says that the number of orbits
of this prism is2(n+1)k
2t=(n+1)k
tfor some 1⩽t⩽2(n+1)
2=n+1.

Example 4.6.LetXbe a 3-maniplex (map), Oa Wythoffian operation and Athe set of reflections
that fix a base vertex for the operation O. Then the number of orbits ofO(X) is given inTable  1.
We need to emphasise the importance of the hypothesis of (Y, η) preserving connectivity.
Without this hypothesis Item(ii)ofProposition  4.3might not hold and unusual examples arise. If
Yis any premaniplex andη(W)=1 for every W∈Π(Y), thenX⋊ηYconsists of|X|disconnected
copies ofY. Its automorphism group isΓ(Y)≀S|X|. The group Γ(X) (as a subgroup ofS|X|) acts on
X⋊ηYby permuting the copies ofY. In general, the index ofΓ(X) inΓ(X⋊ηY) is larger than|Y|.
Moreover, even if (Y, η) satisfies thatX⋊ηYis connected for a certain premaniplex X, if the
operator (Y, η) does not preserve connectivity, then Item(ii)ofProposition  4.3might not hold:
Example 4.7(Unstable Maps, See [15]).A non-orientable mapMisstableif every automorphism
of its orientable double cover is a lift of an automorphism ofM; it is unstable otherwise. In [10,
Example 3.5] we showed that we can see the orientable double cover as a voltage operator (2∅, µ)
with 2∅the two-flag premaniplex with no semiedges andµthe voltage assignment that satisfies
µ(iy)=rifor every 0⩽i⩽2 and y∈2∅. In our language, a stable mapMis a map that satisfies
[Γ(M⋊µ2∅):Γ(M)]⩽2. In [15, Example 2], Jones shows a mapMon the Klein bottle with
|Γ(M)| =8 such that the orientable double cover ofMis the regular toroidal map{4,4}(2,2);
the automorphism group of this map has 64 elements. In this case bothMandM⋊µ2∅are
connected butProposition  4.3does not hold because (2∅, µ) does not preserve connectivity: ifKis
an orientable mapK⋊µ2∅consists of two isomorphic copies ofK.
Unfortunately, many natural operations on maps, polyhedra and polytopes do not preserve
connectivity when seen as voltage operations. As seen above, the orientable double cover is one of
them, but similar examples arise naturally when we consider operations that are only interesting
for a certain family Fof maniplexes (non-orientable, non-vertex-bipartite, etc.) and give as a result
an element of the complementary family F. Often when we apply the operation to a maniplex X
inFwe obtain several isomorphic copies ofX.
Another family of examples of voltage operations that do not preserve connectivity arise when
we need to make a choice when applying the operation (e.g. the snub operation or ‘‘truncate
every second vertex’’). Often when seen as voltage operations the result is a family of disconnected
maniplexes corresponding to each of the possible choices.
5. F-actions and voltage operations
In the previous section, we have characterised the automorphisms ofX⋊ηYthat are induced
by the automorphisms ofXas those fixing theY-coordinate ofX⋊ηY. In this section we find a
necessary condition so that all automorphisms ofX⋊ηYare induced by those ofX. Such a condition
is given inTheorem  5.7in the language ofF-actions.
F-actions were introduced by Orbanić, in [17], as a tool to understand quotients of maps and
hypermaps. They can also be easily used to study maniplexes and polytopes and, as we shall see,
8
I. Hubard, E. Mochán and A. Montero European Journal of Combinatorics 126 (2025) 104132
premaniplexes and, thus, voltage operations. The ideas are similar to some of those used by Hartley
in [8,9] for abstract polytopes. In this section, we introduce F-actions and refer the reader to [17]
for details.
LetFbe a finitely generated and finitely presented group acting (on the left) transitively on a set
Z, and letz0∈Zbe a fixed point that we shall callthe root. AnF-actionis a 4-tuple M=(ϑ ,G,Z,z0),
where Gis a group that acts (on the left) faithfully and transitively onZ,ϑ:F→Gis a group
epimorphism such that forz∈Zand f∈F,f·Fz=ϑ(f)·Gz, and·F,·Gdenote the (left) action of
Fand G, respectively, onZ.
A connected premaniplex Xcan be seen as aC-action (ϑ ,Mon(X),V(X),x0), where V(X) here
denotes the set of flags ofX,x0is abaseflag, andϑ:C→Mon(X) the natural group epimorphism
between Cand the monodromy group ofX.
Given two F-actions M=(ϑM,GM,ZM,zM), and N=(ϑN,GN,ZN,zN), anF-action morphism
between them consists of a pair (ϕ , ψ) such thatϕ:ZM→ZNis an onto mapping satisfying that
ϕ(zM)=zN, andψ:GM→GNis a group epimorphism satisfying thatψ◦ϑM=ϑNand also that
for allg∈GMand z∈ZM, we haveϕ(g·Mz)=ψ(g)·Nϕ(z), where ·M,·Nrepresent the action
ofGMand GNonZMand ZN, respectively. If (ϕ , ψ) are both bijections, then we have anF-action
isomorphism.
LetXbe a connected premaniplex with base flag x0, and N:=StabC(x0). Then K=CoreC(N)
is in fact the kernel {ω∈C|ωy=yfor ally∈X}of the action ofConX, and thus the action
ofC/KonXis faithful, which says that Mon(X)=C/K. By [17, Proposition 3.1], theC-action
(ϑ ,Mon(X),V(X),x) is isomorphic to theC-action (ϑ ,Mon(X),C/N,N). In other words, one may
regard the premaniplex Xto have the flag setC/N, where the base flag x0corresponds toN. In fact,
this is equivalent to regard Xas the coset graph (or Schreier graph) ∆(C,N,{r0,r1, . . . ,rn−1}) (see
for example [12] for details in the case of maniplexes).
Similarly, as in the case with maps and polytopes, [17, Theorem 3.6] implies the following result.
Proposition 5.1. LetXbe a connected premaniplex with base flag x0, and let N=StabC(x0). Then
there is an automorphism αωofXsatisfying that x0αω=ωx0if and only ifω∈Norm C(N), and further,
Γ(X)∼=Norm C(N)/N.
5.1.C-actions and voltage operations
Throughout this section, letXbe a connected n-premaniplex with base flag x0and N:=
StabCn(x0), and let (Y, η) be an (n,m)-voltage operator, lety0∈Ybe a root of the connected m-
premaniplex Yand L:=StabCm(y0). Thus, as discussed above, we regard XandYas theC-actions
(ϑX,Mon(X),Cn/N,N) and (ϑY,Mon(Y),Cm/L,L), respectively.
Of course, whenever X⋊ηYis connected, it can be regarded as aC-action. In this case, we shall
see that the stabiliser of (x0,y0) can be written in terms of the stabiliser ofx0and the morphism
ζ:L→Cngiven byζ(ω)=η(ωy0).
Lemma 5.2. Let x0and y0be the base flags ofXandY, respectively, so that(x0,y0)is the base flag
ofX⋊ηY. ThenStabCm(x0,y0)=ζ−1(N). In particular, ifX⋊ηYis connected it may be regarded as
theCm-action(ϑη,Mon(X⋊ηY),Cm/ζ−1(N), ζ−1(N)).
Proof.Start by noticing that for anyω∈Lwe have that
ω(x0,y0)=(η(ωy0)x0, ωy0)=(ζ(ω)x0, ωy0)=(ζ(ω)x0,y0). (5.1)
Now, ω∈StabCm(x0,y0) implies that (x0,y0)=ω(x0,y0)=(η(ωy0)x0, ωy0), soω∈L. Hence, by
(5.1), (x0,y0)=(ζ(ω)x0,y0), implying thatζ(ω)∈Nand thusω∈ζ−1(N).
On the other hand, ifω∈ζ−1(N), thenω∈L(since ζ:L→Cn), andζ(ω)∈ζ(ζ−1(N))⊆N.
Hence, (x0,y0)=(ζ(ω)x0, ωy0), which by(5.1)equals ω(x0,y0), implying thatω∈StabCm(x0,y0).
We have proved that StabCm(x0,y0)=ζ−1(N). Again, by [17, Proposition 3.1], the connected
component ofX⋊ηYcontaining the flag (x0,y0) may be regarded as theCm-action (ϑη,Mon(X⋊η
Y),Cm/ζ−1(N), ζ−1(N)). This concludes the proof. □

By combiningProposition  5.1withLemma  5.2, we have the following result.
Corollary 5.3. IfX⋊ηYis connected, thenαωis an automorphism ofX⋊ηYsatisfying that
(x0,y0)αω=ω(x0,y0)if and only ifω∈Norm Cζ−1(N), and further,
Γ(X⋊ηY)∼=Norm Cm(ζ−1(N))/ζ−1(N).
Corollary  5.3implies that all symmetries ofX⋊ηYcome from elements of Norm Cm(ζ−1(N)). We
may use this to characterise, in terms ofC-actions, when all the automorphisms ofX⋊ηYcome
from automorphisms ofX.
Proposition 5.4. IfX⋊ηYis connected and every automorphism ofΓ(X⋊ηY)is induced by an
automorphism ofΓ(X), thenNorm C(ζ−1(N))⊆L. Moreover, if(Y, η)preserves connectivity, and
Norm C(ζ−1(N))⊆L, then every automorphism ofΓ(X⋊ηY)is induced by an automorphism ofΓ(X).
Proof.For the first part, byCorollary  5.3, ifω∈Norm C(ζ−1(N)), there exists αω∈Γ(X⋊ηY) such
thatω(x0,y0)=(x0,y0)αω. Since αωis an automorphism ofX⋊ηYinduced by an automorphism
ofX, we have that (x0,y0)αω=(x0α ,y0), for some α∈Γ(X). Hence, (η(ωy0)x0, ωy0)=ω(x0,y0)=
(x0,y0)αω=(x0α ,y0), implying thatωy0=y0, soω∈L.
For the second part, letα∈Γ(X⋊ηY). Since X⋊ηYis connected, there exists ω∈Cmsuch
that (x0,y0)α=ω(x0,y0). ByCorollary  5.3ω∈Norm Cm(ζ−1(N))⊆L, and thusωy0=y0. Now
(x0,y0)α=ω(x0,y0)=(η(ωy0)x0, ωy0)=(η(ωy0)x0,y0), and since (Y, η) preserves connectivity, by
Proposition  4.2every automorphism ofΓ(X⋊ηY) is induced by an automorphism ofΓ(X).□
5.2. Avoiding extra automorphisms in connectivity preserving operations
We know thatΓ(X) acts by automorphisms ofΓ(X⋊ηY). Moreso, in Section4we showed
that every automorphism ofΓ(X⋊ηY) that fixes theY-coordinate of one flag could be regarded
as an automorphism ofXand, further, in the last section, we gave a characterisation, in terms of
C-actions, of when every automorphism ofΓ(X⋊ηY) can be regarded as one fromX.
In fact, we just showed that if we assume that (Y, η) preserves connectivity, thenΓ(X)=
Γ(X⋊ηY) if and only if Norm C(ζ−1(N))⊆L. This implies that any symmetry ofX⋊ηYthat does
not come fromΓ(X) (if any) is induced by an element of Norm C(ζ−1(N))\L.
Since we have characterised this extra symmetry for operations that preserve connectivity, it
shall prove useful to translateProposition  3.1to the language ofC-actions. Since ζ(ω)=η(ωy0), for
ω∈L, then the natural translation is as follows.
Corollary 5.5. The voltage operator(Y, η)preserves connectivity if and only ifYis connected andζ
is onto. In particular, ζ(ζ−1(N))=N whenever(Y, η)preserves connectivity.
Recall that if a premaniplex Zis regarded as theC-action (ϑ ,Mon(Z),C/K,K), for some K⩽C,
then we abuse notation and refer toZasC/K.
Lemma 5.6. LetXbe a connected n-premaniplex and let(Y, η)be an(n,m)-voltage operator that
preserves connectivity. Ifυ∈Norm C(ζ−1(N))\L, thenXcovers Zυ, where Zυ=Cn/ζ(L∩Lυ).
Proof.LetKυ:=L∩Lυ. By [17, Proposition 3.2] we have thatXcovers Zυif and only ifN⩽ζ(Kυ).
Letω∈Nand observe that, byCorollary  5.5,ζ−1(ω)̸ = ∅. Take ˜ω∈ζ−1(ω) and note that
ζ−1(ω)⊆ζ−1(N)⊆L, which implies that˜ω∈L.
Nowυ∈Norm Cm(ζ−1(N)) implies that if we conjugate ˜ωbyυ−1, the result is again inζ−1(N),
which is a subset ofL. That is,˜ωυ−1∈L. Moreover, ˜ω∈Limplies that˜ωυ−1∈Lυ−1, and therefore
˜ωυ−1∈L∩Lυ−1. This in turn implies that˜ω∈L∩Lυ=Kυ, and thusζ(˜ω)∈ζ(Kυ). But˜ω∈ζ−1(ω)
implies thatζ(˜ω)=ω, and therefore ω∈ζ(Kυ).□

Fig. 1.The truncation operator.
The following result is an immediate consequence of the lemma.
Theorem 5.7. If for eachυ∈Cm\L we have thatXdoes not coverZυdefined byZυ=Cn/ζ(L∩Lυ),
then all the symmetries ofX⋊ηYare induced by symmetries ofΓ(X).
FollowingLemma  5.6, for eachυ∈Cmwe setKυ:=L∩Lυ, andZυ:=C/ζ(Kυ). By definition,
there is a bijection between the sets{Kυ|υ∈C}and{Zυ|υ∈C}. Moreover, there is a surjective
function from{Lυ|υ∈Cm}to{Kυ|υ∈Cm}that, in general, is not a bijection. This implies that
|{Zυ|υ∈C}|⩽|{Lυ|υ∈C}| = [C:Norm C(L)].
Now observe that the cosets of Norm C(L) are in correspondence with the orbits ofΓ(Y). In fact, by
Proposition  5.1:
(υNorm C(L))y0=υ(Norm C(L)y0)=υ(y0Γ(Y))=(υy0)Γ(Y).
It follows that[C:Norm C(L)]coincides with the number of orbits ofYunder the action ofΓ(Y).
Therefore, we have the following result.
Lemma 5.8. The number of premaniplexes Zυis bounded by the number of flag orbits ofYunder
Γ(Y).
Example 5.9.As we pointed out in the introduction, the truncation is one of the classical operations
and was studied in [18]. In particular, we observe that [18, Proposition 4.4] can be interpreted
as follows: If the truncation of a mapMhas more symmetries thanM, thenMmust cover
the premaniplex 2{0,1}(the premaniplex inFig. 3). To see this proposition as a particular case of
Theorem  5.7, consider the truncation operator (Y, η) described inFig. 1, together with a base flag
y0. LetMbe a map (i.e. a 3-maniplex). If the truncation ofMhas more symmetries thanM,
Theorem  5.7andLemma  5.8tell us that it must cover either Zr1orZr2r1. As one can see in [18],
L∩Lr1=L∩Lr2r1=⟨
r0,rr1
0,rr1r2
0⟩
. By calculating the voltages of the paths based ony0induced by
these generators we see thatζ(L∩Lr1)=ζ(L∩Lr2r1)=⟨
r0,r1,rr2
1⟩
, which is exactly the stabiliser of
any vertex of2{0,1}. Therefore, Zr1=Zr2r1=2{0,1}.
Note that to useTheorem  5.7, one has to check that for eachυ∈Cm,Xdoes not cover Zυ.
This might seem like a lot of work, butLemma  5.8bounds the number of tests needed by the flag
orbits ofYunder Γ(Y), which is itself bounded by the number of flags ofY. This means that if our
operators have few flags, the number of tests is small.
Moreover, if there is some ω∈L\Lυ, then (L∩Lυ)ω=L∩Lω υ, which in turn implies thatζ(L∩Lυ)
andζ(L∩Lω υ) are conjugates. Then, the main results of [8] say thatZυandZω υare isomorphic. In
terms of premaniplexes, this means that if identifying y0with y=υy0would force us to identify
y0with y1=ω υy0, then the premaniplexes ZυandZω υare isomorphic. Using this, we get an even
smaller number ofZυto check, for example, if the only quotient ofYis1m, we only have to find
oneZυ(υ /∈L) and all others will be isomorphic.
However, there is an inconvenience withTheorem  5.7: it may happen that one of theZυis
1n: then-premaniplex with only one point. This premaniplex is covered by any other premaniplex

(of the same rank), so in this caseTheorem  5.7does not give any useful information. This might
look particularly discouraging when one notices that ifυ∈Norm Cm(L) (that is, when there is an
automorphism ofYmapping y0toυy0), thenZυ=1n. Automorphisms ofX⋊ηYinduced by those
ofYare studied in the next section.
6. Automorphisms induced byY
We have discussed in Section5thatTheorem  5.7does not help us avoid automorphisms of
X⋊ηYcoming fromY. These automorphisms must be studied on their own, so we dedicate this
section to them. Later on, we reformulateTheorem  5.7considering the analysis of this section (see
Theorem  6.10).
Symmetries coming fromYcan be divided into two classes: those that always occur and those
that may or may not occur depending onX. We will start by studying the first class.
The prism over any polygon has a symmetry swapping the two lids. More generally, the prism
over any premaniplex Xadmits an automorphism that swaps two facets isomorphic toX. This
symmetry can be seen as a symmetry of the prism operator itself; inFig. 2, this symmetry is
a horizontal reflection. Symmetries of the premaniplex Ysuch as the one described above often
induce additional symmetry onX⋊ηYregardless of the choice ofX, they do exactly when their
symmetry preserves the voltage assignment η. We shall now formally explain what this means.
We say that an automorphism τofYlifts toX⋊ηYif there is an automorphism ˜τofX⋊ηY
such that for every (x,y)∈X⋊ηY,
(x,y)˜τ=(x′,yτ);
or equivalently, that the following diagram commutes:
X⋊ηY X ⋊ηY
Y Y˜τ
τ
(6.1)
where the vertical arrows are the natural projections. The automorphism ˜τis called aliftofτ; we
also say that˜τprojectstoτ.
Note that the automorphisms ofXacting onX⋊ηYare lifts of the identity inY, and ifXis
connected and (Y, η) preserves connectivity, byProposition  4.2, then every lift of the identity is an
12
I. Hubard, E. Mochán and A. Montero European Journal of Combinatorics 126 (2025) 104132
automorphism ofX.
Of course, eachτ∈Ymay have more than one lift. In particular, ifXhas non-trivial symmetries,
then the identity inYhas more than one lift (actually, at least as many as symmetries ofX).
Symmetries ofYpreserving ηalways lift; more precisely:
Theorem 6.1. Let(Y, η)be a voltage operator. Suppose Yhas an automorphism τsuch that
η(Wτ)=η(W) (6.2)
for all paths W∈Π(Y). Then, for every n-premaniplex X,τhas a lift˜τ∈Γ(X⋊ηY)satisfying
(x,y)˜τ=(x,yτ)
for every(x,y)∈X×Y.
Proof.Let˜τbe defined as above. Then, for alli∈ {0,1, . . . ,n−1},
((x,y)i)˜τ=(η(iy)x,yi)˜τ
=(η(iy)x,(yi)τ)
=(η(iy)x,(yτ)i)
=(η(iyτ)x,(yτ)i)
=(x,yτ)i
=((x,y)˜τ)i.
This proves that˜τis an automorphism ofX⋊ηY.□
The proof of the above theorem implies the following result.
Corollary 6.2. Let(Y, η)be a voltage operator and letΓ(Y, η)denote the subgroup ofΓ(Y)consisting
of all automorphisms τofYsatisfying(6.2). Then⟨Γ(X),Γ(Y, η)⟩ =Γ(X)×Γ(Y, η).
Ifσ∈Γ(X) andτ∈Γ(Y, η), if we consider the action ofΓ(Y, η) given inTheorem  6.1, then
byCorollary  6.2, (x,y)(σ , τ)=(xσ ,yτ), for (x,y)∈X⋊ηY. Thus, (σ , τ) can be thought of as a lift
ofτ. That is, every automorphism ofXgives a lift ofτ(whenever τ∈Γ(Y) lifts).
Note that there might be automorphisms ofX⋊ηYthat are not inΓ(X)×Γ(Y, η). For example,
if (Y, η) is the medial operator (seeFig. 3),Ydoes not have an automorphism satisfying the
conditions of the above theorem. However, it is well-known that whenever Xis self-dual, X⋊ηY
has symmetries not coming from the automorphisms ofX(see [18, Theorem 4.1]). Such extra
symmetry can be thought of as an automorphism τofYthat does not preserve the voltages. Such
symmetries do not necessarily lift for every premaniplex. Now, we want to explore these cases when
the automorphisms τof the operators lift only for some premaniplexes X, just as in the example
of the medial operator.
Let (Y, η) be an (n,m)-voltage operator. Suppose that there exists τ∈Γ(Y) such that there
exists a group homomorphism τ#:Cn→Cnsatisfying that
τ#(η(W))=η(Wτ), (6.3)
for every W∈Π(Y). We shall see inProposition  6.4that, under certain conditions, suchτlifts to
an automorphism ofX⋊ηY. We need to define some things in order to be able to understand the
conditions ofProposition  6.4. We can useτ#to define a new voltage operator (1n, τ#), where the
semi-edge of colour iof1nhas voltage τ#(ri) for alli∈ {0,1, . . . ,n−1}. Note that by doing this we
are abusing notation: τ#is a homomorphism, and we are also using τ#for the voltage assignment.
Observe that whenever τ#is an automorphism ofCnthis new voltage operation can be though as
ad-automorphism (see [10, Example 3.1] and [13]).
Now, given a premaniplex Xwe define the premaniplex Xτ#as the premaniplex X⋊τ#1n.
13
I. Hubard, E. Mochán and A. Montero European Journal of Combinatorics 126 (2025) 104132
Fig. 3.The medial operator.
Theorem 6.3. Let(Y, η)be an(n,m)-voltage operator and letτ∈Γ(Y)be such thatτ#:Cn→Cn
satisfying(6.3)exists. Then, for every n-premaniplex X, the premaniplex Xτ#⋊ηYis isomorphic to
X⋊ηY.
Proof.Using [10, Theorem 6.1] we get that:
Xτ#⋊ηY=(X⋊τ#1n)⋊ηY=X⋊θ(1n⋊ηY),
where, ifz0is the only vertex of1n,θ(ω(z0,y))=τ#(η(wy)z0). Note that by definition, 1n⋊ηY∼=Y.
This means that one can think thatθis actually a voltage assignment onYsuch thatθ(ωy):=
τ#(η(ωy))=η(ωyτ). Therefore, Xτ#⋊ηY=X⋊θY, so we actually need to prove thatX⋊θYis
isomorphic toX⋊ηY.
We claim that the function (x,y)↦ →(x,yτ) is an isomorphism fromX⋊θYtoX⋊ηY. Since τis
an automorphism ofY, it is clearly a bijection, so to prove that it is an isomorphism, we only need
to prove that the mapping preserves i-adjacencies for alli∈ {0,1, . . . ,n−1}. When we calculate
thei-adjacent vertex of (x,y) inX⋊θYwe get
(x,y)i=(θ(iy)x,yi)=(τ#(η(iy))x,yi)=(η(iyτ)x,yi),
and this maps to
(η(iyτ)x,(yi)τ)=(η(iyτ)x,(yτ)i)
which is thei-adjacent vertex to (x,yτ) inX⋊ηY.□
As expected, a clear example ofTheorem  6.3is the fact that a polyhedron and its dual have the
same medial. We can see that the medial operator has a unique non-trivial symmetry τ(Fig. 3).
This symmetry interchanges the semi-edge with voltage r0with the one with voltage r2, and
also interchanges the semi-edges with voltage r1. This means that (13, τ#) is the duality operator
(13,[r2,r1,r0]).Theorem  6.3tells us that every 3-premaniplex Xhas the same medial as its dual
Xτ#=X∗. Similarly, considering [10, Figure 4 and Figure 7, respectively], one can see that the snub
of a polyhedron and its dual are isomorphic, and the trapezotope over a polytope and its dual are
isomorphic (the latter can be seen in the figure when considering the central inversion on the cube
Zn
2, which maps every vector to its logic conjugate).
In the case when Xτ#is isomorphic toX,Theorem  6.3does not give any new information.
However, in this case, we see that the isomorphism between Xτ#andXtogether withτinduces a
new automorphism of the product X⋊ηY, as we see in the following theorem.
Proposition 6.4. LetXbe a premaniplex and let(Y, η)be a voltage operator. Letτ∈Γ(Y)be such
thatτ#:Cn→Cnsatisfies(6.3)exists, and suppose thatXτ#is isomorphic toX. Thenτlifts toX⋊ηY.
14
I. Hubard, E. Mochán and A. Montero European Journal of Combinatorics 126 (2025) 104132
Proof.Letϕ:X→Xτ#be an isomorphism. Note that, due to how the monodromy ofXτ#is
defined, this means that (η(W)x)ϕ=η(Wτ)(xϕ) for every path W∈Π(Y) and every vertex xinX.
We claim that the mapping (x,y)↦ →(xϕ ,yτ) is an automorphism ofX⋊ηY. In fact, for all
i∈ {0,1, . . . ,n−1}, the vertex (x,y)i=(η(iy)x,yi) is mapped to
((η(iy)x)ϕ ,(yi)τ)=((η(iy)x)ϕ ,(yτ)i)
=(η(i(yτ))(xϕ),(yτ)i).
Finally we observe that (η(i(yτ))(xϕ),(yτ)i) is exactly thei-adjacent vertex to (xϕ ,yτ).□
Note that for any W∈Π(Y),η(W) is an element ofCn, and thus one can define η(W) as the
corresponding element of Mon(X). That is, for every x∈X,η(W)x=η(W)x. Observe further that
whenever X∼=Xτ#, the morphism τ#:Cn→Cninduces a morphism τ#:Mon(X)→Mon(X) that
satisfies
τ#(η(W))=η(Wτ), (6.4)
for every W∈Π(Y). However, given τ∈Γ(Y), there may be a morphism τ#satisfying(6.4)for
some X, even ifτ#:Cn→Cndoes not exist. In such a case, we may define Xτ#as the premaniplex
with the same flags asX, and the i-adjacencies given byxi=τ#(ri)x, for every x∈Xand
i∈ {0,1, . . . ,n−1}. The proof of the following result is exactly the same as that ofProposition  6.4.
Theorem 6.5. LetXbe an n-premaniplex and let(Y, η)be an(n,m)-voltage operator. Letτ∈Γ(Y)
be such thatτ#:Mon(X)→Mon(X)satisfying(6.4)exists. Suppose thatXis isomorphic toXτ#. Then
τlifts toX⋊ηY.
In fact, whenever we restrict ourselves to connected premaniplexes, all the automorphisms ofY
that lift to automorphisms ofX⋊ηYare precisely the ones covered in the above theorem, as we
shall see in the following result.
Theorem 6.6. LetXbe a connected n-premaniplex and let(Y, η)be an(n,m)-voltage operator that
preserves connectivity. Letτ∈Γ(Y)be an automorphism that lifts. Then there exists a morphism
τ#:Mon(X)→Mon(X)that satisfies(6.4), andX∼=Xτ#.
Proof.Let˜τbe a lift ofτ. There exists a function θ:X⋊ηY→Csuch that (x,y)˜τ=(θ(x,y)x,yτ),
for all (x,y)∈X⋊ηY.
By using the same argument as the one used at the beginning of the proof ofLemma  4.1, one
can see that ify,y′∈Y, thenθ(x,y)x=θ(x,y′)x, implying that the action ofθonxdoes not depend
on theY-coordinate, and thus we may denote θ(x,y) simply asθ(x). We shall abuse the notation
and refer toθ(x) as an element ofCor its corresponding element in Mon(X), depending on the
situation, as we shall only useθ(x) to act on elements ofX.
Letω∈Cn. Then, similar to the proof ofLemma  4.1, on the one hand, we have that
(ω(x,y))˜τ=(η(ωy)x, ωy)˜τ=(θ(η(ωy)x)η(ωy)x, ωyτ).
On the other hand,
ω((x,y)˜τ)=ω(θ(x)x,yτ)=(η(ωyτ)θ(x)x, ωyτ).
Since ˜τ∈Γ(X⋊ηY), then (ω(x,y))˜τ=ω((x,y)˜τ), implying that
θ(η(ωy)x)η(ωy)x=η(ωyτ)θ(x)x,
which in turn implies that
θ(η(ωy)x)η(ωy)x=η(ωyτ)θ(x)x, (6.5)

Letϕ:X→Xdefined byxϕ=θ(x)x. We claim thatϕis a bijection. First note that
˜τ∈Γ(X⋊ηY), implies that (˜τ)−1is well defined. Hence, given x∈X, and y∈Ywe have that
(x,y)(˜τ)−1=(x′,y′), for some x′∈Xand y′∈Y. This implies that (x,y)=(x′,y′)˜τ=(θ(x′)x′,y′τ),
and sox=θ(x′)x′tells us thatϕis onto. On the other hand, ifθ(x)x=θ(x′)x′, then fory∈Y,
(x,y)˜τ=(θ(x)x,yτ)=(θ(x′)x′,yτ)=(x′,y)˜τ. Since ˜τis a bijection, then x=x′.
Let us now define τ#:Mon(X)→Mon(X) such that forω∈Cnand x∈X,
τ#(ω)x=(ω(xϕ−1))ϕ;
it is straightforward to see thatτ#(ω1ω2)=τ#(ω1)τ#(ω2), soτ#is a morphism.
Moreover, by definition we have that
τ#(ω)(xϕ)=(ω(x))ϕ=θ(ω(x))ωx.
Then, for anyωy∈Πy(Y) we have that, by(6.5),
τ#(η(ωy))(xϕ)=θ(η(ωy)x)η(ωy)x=η(ωyτ)θ(x)x=η(ωyτ)(xϕ).
Since ϕis a bijection, thenτ#(η(ωy)) andη(ωyτ) are elements of Mon(X) that act in the same way
in every element ofX, implying that
τ#(η(ωy))=η(ωyτ),
which in turn implies thatτ#is a morphism that satisfies(6.4). The isomorphism between Xand
Xτ#is given byϕ.□
A natural question to ask after the last two results is:
Question 6.7. Ifτ∈Yinduces an automorphism τ#ofMon(X)satisfying(6.4), for some premaniplex
X, isXisomorphic toXτ#?
Theorems  6.5and6.6offer a characterisation of when an automorphism ofYlifts to an
automorphism ofX⋊ηY. A direct consequence is that the setΓof automorphisms ofYthat lift to
X⋊ηYis a subgroup ofΓ(Y). Furthermore, if˜Γdenotes the set of automorphisms ofX⋊ηYthat
project toΓ, then ˜Γis a group and there is a surjective group homomorphism π:˜Γ→Γ.
On the other hand, ifXis connected and (Y, η) preserves connectivity,Proposition  4.2charac-
terises the automorphisms ofXas the automorphisms ofX⋊ηYthat project toidY. In particular,
we can think ofΓ(X) as a subgroup of˜Γ. In other words, we have proved the following result.
Proposition 6.8. LetXbe a connected premaniplex, and(Y, η)be a voltage operator that preserves
connectivity. LetΓ⩽Γ(Y)the group of automorphisms that lift and let˜Γ⩽Γ(X⋊ηY)the subgroup
of automorphisms ofX⋊ηYthat project toΓ. Then˜Γis a group extension ofΓ(X)byΓ. That is, there
exists a sequence of homomorphisms Γ(X) ˜Γ Γι π
Such thatι(Γ(X))=ker(π).
In particular, it follows thatι(Γ(X))◁˜Γ,˜Γ/ι(Γ(X))∼=Γand ifXandYare finite, then
|˜Γ| = |Γ(X)∥Γ|.
As expected, the medial operator is an example ofProposition  6.4: ifτis the non-trivial
symmetry ofY, as discussed above, the voltage operator (13, τ#) is the dual operator in rank 3.
That is,Xτ#is the dual ofX. Hence, the theorem says that when Xis self-dual, then the symmetry
τofYlifts to˜τ∈Γ(X⋊ηY). Note that such a lift sends a flag (x,y) ofX⋊ηYto a flag (xδ ,yτ),
where δis a duality. In fact, in this case,Γ(X⋊ηY) has no other elements than those coming from
Γ(X) and the lifts ofτ. Since Γ(X) always has index 2 inΓ(X⋊ηY), it is normal.
Whenever Xis a self-dual premaniplex such that there exists a duality δof order 2, then
Γ(X⋊ηY)∼=Γ(X)⋊⟨δ⟩∼=Γ(X)⋊C2. On the other hand, ifXdoes not have a duality of order 2
(see [14]), then the automorphims that do not come fromΓ(X) are lifts ofτ, and thus send (x,y)
to (xδ ,yτ), where δis a duality. Since no duality has order two, no lift ofτhas order two, implying
thatΓ(X⋊ηY) cannot be seen as a semi-direct product ofΓ(X) byC2. In particular, this implies
that the extension ofProposition  6.8does not necessarily split.

As pointed out before,Theorems  6.5and6.6characterise the automorphisms ofYthat lift to an
automorphism ofX⋊ηY. In fact, when we ask for connectivity the result is stronger, as we shall
see, in the sense that if an automorphism ofX⋊ηYacts like a lift ofτ∈Γ(Y) in one flag, it must
actually be a lift ofτ.
Lemma 6.9. LetX⋊ηYbe connected. Letγ∈Γ(X⋊ηY)andτ∈Γ(Y). If for some(x0,y0)∈X⋊ηY
and x1∈Xit happens that(x0,y0)γ=(x1,y0τ), thenγis a lift ofτ.
Proof.Let (x,y)∈X⋊ηY. SinceX⋊ηYis connected, there exists ω∈Csuch that (x,y)=ω(x0,y0).
Note that in particular ωy0=y. Then,
(x,y)γ=(ω(x0,y0))γ
=ω((x0,y0)γ)
=ω(x1,y0τ)
=(η(ω(y0τ))x1, ωy0τ)
=(η(ω(y0τ))x1,yτ).□
Note thatProposition  4.2is actually a corollary of the above lemma, in the particular case where
τis the identity automorphism ofY. With this in mind, we state the following theorem, which is
similar toTheorem  5.7. Recall that L=StabCm(y0) andZυ=Cn/ζ(L∩Lυ).
Theorem 6.10. LetXbe a connected premaniplex and(Y, η)a voltage operator that preserves
connectivity. If for eachυ∈Cm\Norm Cm(L)we find thatXdoes not coverZυ, then every automorphism
ofX⋊ηYis a lift of an automorphism ofY.
Proof.Letx0and y0be the base flags ofXandY, respectively. Letγ∈Γ(X⋊ηY), and letυ∈Cm
be such that (x0,y0)γ=υ(x0,y0). Then, byCorollary  5.3,υ∈Norm Cm(ζ−1(N)).
By hypothesis, ifυ /∈Norm Cm(L), thenXdoes not cover Zυ. On the other hand, byLemma  5.6,
ifυ∈Norm Cm(ζ−1(N))\L, thenXcovers Zυ. This implies thatυ∈Norm Cm(L) (note that
L⊆Norm Cm(L)).
Proposition  5.1implies now that there exists τ∈Y, such thatυy0=y0τ. ByLemma  6.9we
have thatγis a lift ofτ. (Note that in particular ifυ∈L, thenγ∈Γ(X) (seeProposition  5.4), and
thusγis a lift of the identity automorphism ofY.)□
Because ofLemma  5.8, the number of premaniplexes Zυto check is at most the number of orbits
ofYminus one.
7. Concluding remarks
Theorem  6.10tells us that if a connected premaniplex Xdoes not cover the premaniplexes of a
(usually small) family depending onY, all the automorphisms ofX⋊ηYcan be described in terms
of the automorphisms ofXandY. UsingTheorem  6.5,Corollary  6.2and the wayΓ(X) is embedded
inΓ(X⋊ηY) (as described in Section3), we can summarise the description ofσ∈Γ(X⋊ηY) as
a lift of an automorphism ofYas follows:
The general lifts.The automorphism σis the lift of an automorphism τ∈Γ(Y) such that there
exists τ#:Mon(X)→Mon(X) satisfying(6.4),ϕ:X→Xτ#is an isomorphism and
(x,y)σ=(xϕ ,yτ)
for every (x,y)∈X⋊ηY(seeTheorem  6.5);
The lifts when τ#is the identity inMon(X).A particular case of the above is when τ#is the identity
in Mon(X), thenXτ#=Xandϕis actually an automorphism ofX. In this case,σ∈Γ(X)×Γ(Y, η)
(seeCorollary  6.2);

Fig. 4.The cube{4,3}as the truncated {2,4}, which is itself the medial of{2,2}.
The lifts induced by the identity automorphism ofY.We now see a particular case of the above
situation. That is, ifτ=idY(which in particular implies thatτ#is the identity in Mon(X)), then
σ∈Γ(X) (seeLemma  4.1).
It is now evident that the additional symmetries of the medial of a self-dual polyhedron or that of
the prism over a polytope that is not a prism are included in the preceding overview. Nevertheless,
for certain premaniplexes Xand operators (Y, η), there may be automorphisms ofX⋊ηYthat do
not fit the above description. Examples of this include the prism over hypercubes or the truncation
of some maps.
Let us go back to consider the truncation operator (Y, η) (seeFig. 1). ThenYhas no non-trivial
automorphisms. Therefore, the above discussion seems to imply that the only automorphisms of
X⋊ηYthat we consider are those fromX. However, for example, the truncation of the regular
tessellation of the plane by equilateral triangles is again a regular tessellation, so it actually has
symmetries not coming from those of the triangular tessellation. Another example of a truncation
with more symmetry than the one originating fromXis that of the map on the sphere of type{2,4}:
it is straightforward to see that if (Y, η) is the truncation operator, thenX⋊ηYis the cubeP= {4,3}
and the symmetries of the cube induced byXare those that do not move a pair of opposite faces
(seeExample  5.9and [18, Propositions 4.3 and 4.4], for more details about the truncation having
additional symmetry than that coming from the original map).
Observe that the key to understanding the possible additional symmetry in the truncation is to
recognise Xitself as the result of another operation: the medial operation. Let us explain this idea

Fig. 5.If (Z, ϑ) and (Y, η) are the medial and truncation operators, respectively, then (Z⋊ηY, θ) is the omnitruncation,
where θ=θ(ϑ , η).
a bit more in more detail.
Again, denote the truncation operator by (Y, η), and let (Z, ϑ) be the medial operator. Consider
W={2,2}(seeFig. 4), and observe thatW⋊ϑZis precisely X, the map{2,4}. By [10, Theorem
6.1],P=X⋊ηY∼=W⋊θ(Z⋊ηY), where θ=θ(ϑ , η).
Now, as seen inFig. 5, (Z⋊ηY, θ) is the omnitruncation operator (see [10, Fig. 3E]). The
premaniplex (Z⋊ηY) has S3as automorphism group, and every automorphism τinduces an
isomorphism τ#:Mon(W)→Mon(W) (notice thatΓ(W)∼=Mon(W)∼=⟨r0⟩×⟨r1⟩×⟨r2⟩) satisfying
(6.4).Theorem  6.5implies thatτlifts toP=W⋊θ(Z⋊ηY). It follows fromProposition  6.8that
the group ˜Γ⩽(P) induced by lifts ofΓ(Z⋊ηY) is a group extension ofΓ(W) byS3. In particular,
|˜Γ| =48=Γ(P), that is, every automorphism of the group Pis a lift of an automorphism of
Z⋊ηY.
One may wonder about the regular triangle tessellation and its truncation: can we understand
the additional symmetry in a similar matter? The answer is yes!, if done with caution. In this case,
as shown inFig. 6, the suitable Wis (the flag-graph of) the regular (universal) hypermap of type
(3,3,3) (see [2] for details about regular hypermaps).
In other words, if we extend our universe and drop the condition in our definition of premaniplex
that ifi,j∈{0, . . . ,n−1}are such that|i−j|⩾2, then the alternating paths of length 4 with
colours i,jare closed, then we have precomplexes(see [19] for the definition of a complex). In this
way, we can always understand the additional symmetry of the truncation as a result of the original
premaniplex being the medial of a precomplex. This can be seen as follows: by [18, Proposition 4.4]
if the truncation ofXhas extra symmetry, thenXcovers the premaniplex 2{0,1}(seeExample  5.9).
This implies that the faces ofXcan be coloured with two colours in such a way that faces that share
an edge have different colours. Hence, we can think of the hypermap Wwhose faces correspond
to the faces of one colour, its vertices to the faces of the other colour, and its hyperedges to the
vertices ofX. It is not difficult then to convince oneself thatXis the medial ofW. Hence, the
possible additional symmetry of Tr(X) appears if and only ifWis self-dual. Note further that the

premaniplex Zactually coincides with the premaniplex 2{0,1}. This is not coincidence, the maniplex
2{0,1}is precisely aZυ, where Zυis as inLemma  5.6(seeExample  5.9).
That is, in the particular case of the truncation, we have been able to understand the additional
symmetry. Can we do the same for any other voltage operations? Note that, for the prism or pyramid
operators, this has been answered in [6], where they are considered as specific products: the prism
(resp. pyramid) overPhas additional symmetry if and only ifPis itself a prism (resp. pyramid)(this
is a particular case of [6, Theorem A]). That is, the additional symmetry of the prism or pyramid of
an-maniplex Xarises when Xcan be written as the prism or pyramid of an (n−1)-maniplex.

As voltage operations, if (Yn, ηn) denotes the prism or pyramid operator over ann-polytope, [6,
Theorem A] says thatP⋊ηnYnhas additional symmetry if and only ifP∼=W⋊ηn−1Yn−1, for some
(n−1)-polytope W. In particular, Pcovers Yn−1. On the other hand,Theorem  6.10tells us that if
P⋊ηnYnhas additional symmetry, thenPcovers some premaniplex Zυ(defined as inLemma  5.6).
For small values ofn, with the help of GAP [1] one can see that, in fact,Yn−1coincides with all the
Zυcoming fromTheorem  6.10.
This leads us to finish this paper with the following conjecture.
Conjecture.LetXbe a connected premaniplex and let (Y, η) be a voltage operator that preserves
connectivity. IfXcannot be regarded asX∼=W⋊ϑZυ, for a precomplex Wand a connectivity-
preserving operator (Zυ, ϑ), where Zυis defined as inLemma  5.6, then all the elements of
Γ(X⋊ηY) are lifts of automorphisms ofY.
