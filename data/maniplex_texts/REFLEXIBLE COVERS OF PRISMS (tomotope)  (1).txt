Abstract. The Tomotope provided the first well understood example of an abstract 4-polytope
whose connection (monodromy) group was not a string C-group, and which also did not have a
unique minimal regular cover. Conversely, we know that if the connection group of a polytope is a
string C-group (if the polytope is C-connected ), then the polytope will have a unique minimal regu-
lar cover. Since the discovery of the Tomotope, an active area of investigation has been determining
which abstract d-polytopes are C-connected and the ways various constructions for abstract poly-
topes result in polytopes that do or do not possess unique minimal regular covers. In the current
work we show that the prism over every abstract polyhedron is C-connected, or equivalently, that
it has a unique minimal regular cover. We also describe a conjecture positing a general condition
on the C-connectedness of prisms over polytopes that is independent of rank.
1.Introduction
Abstract polytopes have been used extensively since the 1980s to investigate and generalize the
combinatorial and symmetry properties of convex polytopes. While much of the early work focused
on the most symmetric class, the regular abstract polytopes, since the early 1990s there has been in-
creasing activity investigating abstract polytopes that, while still highly symmetric, are not regular.
Two major closely related threads have emerged in the study of less symmetric abstract polytopes:
the use of covers of abstract polytopes by abstract regular polytopes, pioneered by Hartley [9, 10],
and the analysis of the connection (or monodromy) group of a polytope (see, especially, [12, 15]. In
this paper we apply methods developed by Cunningham, Pellicer and Williams [16, 3] to investigate
properties of the connection groups of prisms over abstract polytopes. The main result of the paper
is Theorem 4.10, in which we show that every prism constructed over a polyhedron has a unique
minimal regular cover.
2.Polytopes, Maniplexes and Pre-maniplexes
Here we will review some of the basic definitions and results required for the present work, as
well as introduce our notational conventions. For additional details on regular abstract polytopes
the standard reference is [13]; for more information about connection groups we refer the reader to
[15] (where they are called monodromy groups ); further details about maniplexes can be found in
[19] and [4, 6, 17] (though the definitions in this area are still evolving).
2.1.Groups. If Γ = ⟨γ0, γ1, . . . , γ d−1⟩is a group generated by involutions γisuch that |γiγj|= 2
for all |i−j|>1, then we say Γ is a string group generated by involutions orsggi. They are called
string groups since this is exactly how a Coxeter group whose diagram is a string (or simple path)
is generated (see below). If kiis the order of γi−1γifor 1≤i≤d−1, then we say that the typeof
Γ is{k1, . . . , k d−1}(to be clear, this denotes a sequence rather than a set, but we use curly braces

for historical reasons). An sggi Γ is a string C-group if it also satisfies the intersection condition ,
namely, that
⟨γi|i∈I⟩ ∩ ⟨γj|j∈J⟩=⟨γk|k∈I∩J⟩
for all I, J⊆ {0,1, . . . , d −1}. The Coxeter group [ k1, . . . , k d−1] is the group ⟨γ0, . . . , γ d−1⟩with
defining relations
γ2
i= 1 for 0 ≤i≤d−1,
(γi−1γi)ki= 1 for 1 ≤i≤d−1,
(γiγj)2= 1 for 0 ≤i < j−1≤d−2.
2.2.Polytopes. Anabstract d-polytope Pis a ranked partially ordered set whose elements are
called faces satisfying the following four properties:
P1. There is a unique maximal face of rank d, and a unique minimal face of rank −1.
P2. All maximal chains have the same length, and contain a face of each rank.
P3. (Diamond condition) Given faces F≤G, with rank( F) =i−1 and rank( G) =i+ 1, there are
exactly two faces Hof rank isatisfying F≤H≤G.
P4. The poset is strongly flag-connected (see below).
Maximal chains in Pare known as flags; we denote the set of flags of PbyF(P). Two flags are
said to be i-adjacent if they differ by exactly one face of rank i(ori-face). A poset satisfying
P1 and P2 is said to be flag-connected if for any two flags Φ and Ψ of P, there exists a sequence
of flags Φ = Φ 0,Φ1, . . . , Φk= Ψ such that each Φ jis adjacent to Φ j+1, and it is strongly flag-
connected if such a sequence can always be found where each Φ jcontains Φ ∩Ψ. We denote the
unique flag differing from Φ at rank iby Φi. A function f:P → Q is arank and adjacency
preserving map or arap-map if rank( F) = rank(( F)f) for all faces F∈ Pand if (Φi)f= (Φf)ifor
alli∈ {0,1, . . . , d −1}and Φ ∈ F(P). The automorphism group Aut (P) is the set of rank and
adjacency preserving bijective maps of Pto itself; elements of Aut ( P) are typically written using
Greek lower-case letters, and act on the right. A polytope Pisregular if Aut ( P) acts transitively
onF(P).
For any (base) flag Φ, the automorphism group of a regular polytope can be generated by the
involutions ρithat send Φ to Φifor each i. Furthermore, if Γ = ⟨ρ0, . . . , ρ d−1⟩is the automorphism
group of a regular polytope P, then the group Γ+=⟨ρ0ρ1, ρ1ρ2, . . . , ρ d−2ρd−1⟩is called the rotation
subgroup of Γ. The index of Γ+in Γ is at most 2. When the index is 2, we say that Pis an orientable
regular polytope.
A surjective rap-map π:R → P is acovering of polytopes; such a covering is indicated by
R ↘ P . We note that if Pis known to be flag connected then the rap-map is always surjective.
The automorphism group of any regular abstract polytope is a string C-group [13, Section 2E]. A
minimal regular cover MRC ( P) of a polytope Pis a regular abstract polytope such that whenever
there is a regular abstract polytope Rsuch that MRC ( P)↘ R ↘ P , it must be the case that
R∼=MRC ( P). Not every polytope has a unique minimal regular cover; see [14, Theorem 5.9].
We will also be interested in the connection (ormonodromy ) group Conn ( P) of the polytope,
which is the sggi ⟨r0, r1, . . . , r d−1⟩where ri:F(P)→ F(P) sends each flag Φ of Pto its i-adjacent
neighbor. In our treatment, elements of Conn ( P) act on the left. By Proposition 3.16 of [15], if
Conn ( P) is a string C-group, then there is, up to isomorphism, a unique minimal regular cover
MRC ( P) ofPwhose automorphism group is an sggi isomorphic to Conn ( P).
An abstract 3-polytope is also known as a polyhedron . The connection group of any polyhedron
is a string C-group (see, e.g., [15]).

2.3.Graphs. The terminology of graph theory in applications such as this is sufficiently inconsis-
tent that we feel compelled to take a moment and clarify how we use the standard vocabulary. A
graph G:= (V, E) is an ordered pair where Vis a set of vertices ornodes , and the edges Eis a list
of multisets of elements of Vsuch that if e∈E, then 1 ≤ |e| ≤2. If|e|= 1, we say that eis a
semi-edge . We could represent a loop as a multiset with the same vertex repeated twice; however,
since we will not consider graphs with loops in this manuscript, all edges will be actual subsets of
V.
Thedegree of a vertex v∈Vis the cardinality of star( v) :={e∈E:v∈e}. An edge coloring of
a graph with colors from a set Sis a function ϕ:E→S, and it is proper ifϕ(e1)̸=ϕ(e2) for all
distinct pairs of edges e1ande2with e1∩e2̸=∅; ifGis properly edge-colored with |S|=d, then
Gisproperly d-edge-colored . The graph is k-regular if the degree of every vertex in Gisk. The
graph Gissimple ifEis a set (that is, there are no multiple edges between nodes) and if |e|= 2
for all e∈E(that is, there are no semi-edges). A graph is connected if for all pairs v1, v2∈V,
there exists a sequence of edges e1, e2, . . . , e nsuch that v1∈e1, v2∈enandei∩ei+1̸=∅for all
i∈ {1,2, . . . , n −1}. Naturally, we may visualize a graph by drawing the vertices as dots and
connecting them by curves when they belong to an edge. For a semi-edge, only one endpoint of the
curve is designated as a vertex.
We may associate to every d-polytope Pitsflag graph FG(P), whose nodes are F(P), with edges
colored iconnecting flags if they are i-adjacent. Such a graph is a d-regular, connected, properly
d-edge-colored simple graph. The automorphism group of Phas an induced natural faithful action
onFG(P) via its action on the flags, since the automorphisms preserve flag adjacency.
2.4.Maniplexes. LetGbe a connected d-regular graph, with proper edge coloring by the labels
{0,1, . . . , d −1}. Let the connection group of G, Conn ( G) =⟨g0, g1, . . . , g d−1⟩, be the permutation
group on the vertices of Gwhere for all v, w∈ G,giv=wiffvandware in an edge of Gwith
label i. We note that gifixes vifvis in a semi-edge with label i. Vertices v, w∈ Garei-adjacent
iffgiv=w(thus vis adjacent to itself if vis incident to a semi-edge of color i). If gigj=gjgi
whenever |i−j|>1, then we say Gis apre-maniplex of rank d. If we further require that Gbe a
simple graph then Gis amaniplex of rank d. (In some works, such as [11], pre-maniplexes are not
required to be connected.). Note that Conn ( G) is an sggi when Gis a maniplex.
Observe that every flag graph of an abstract polytope is a maniplex (though the implication does
not go the other direction). It is natural then to call the nodes of a pre-maniplex flags without
causing confusion. Given a flag Φ ∈ G, with Ga pre-maniplex, we denote by Φithe flag that is
i-adjacent to Φ, i.e., giΦ = Φi. We extend this notation by defining Φi1···ik= (Φi1···ik−1)ik. Notice
that Φi1···ik=gik···gi1Φ.
Note that every sggi C=⟨c0, c1, . . . , c d−1⟩that is a permutation group determines a pre-maniplex
Gby letting the flags of Gbe the moved points of Cwith edges determined by the action of the
generators of Cand labeled with the index of the corresponding generator, and vice versa. (Note
that individual generators cimay have fixed points, but in order to get a connected structure, we
need every flag to be moved by at least one generator.) Arbitrary sggis determine maniplexes by
their left action on themselves, with the flags being the elements of Cand edges labeled with the
index of the corresponding generator of C.
Rap-maps are a way of distinguishing those polytope homomorphisms that have a well behaved
action on the associated flag graph, and maniplexes and pre-maniplexes are the family of graphs that
best describe the broader family of edge-labeled graphs to which flag graphs belong. We therefore
find it convenient when adapting results about rap-maps to maniplexes and pre-maniplexes to
have similar, but distinct, terminology at our disposal. Hence, an elap-map π:G → H of pre-
maniplexes preserves edge labels and adjacency; equivalently, it is an edge-color preserving graph
homomorphism. It is worth noting here that we mean that πis color preserving in the strict sense
that if edge ehas label i, then so does eπ. A surjective elap-map is a covering of pre-maniplexes,
REFLEXIBLE COVERS OF PRISMS 199
and if there exists a surjective elap-map from GtoH, we denote that by G ↘ H . We note that if
GandHare connected, then an elap-map from GtoHis always a covering.
Lemma 2.1. Suppose η:M → N is a elap-map of pre-maniplexes with rank d. For any flag Φof
Mandi1, i2, . . . , i k∈ {0, . . . , d −1}, we have
((Φ)η)i1i2···ik= (Φi1i2···ik)η.
Proof. Since ηis edge label and adjacency preserving, we have (Ψj)η= (Ψ η)jfor any flag Ψ and
0≤j≤d−1. The result follows from induction. □
The set of bijective elap-maps from a pre-maniplex Gto itself is the automorphism group Aut (G)
ofG, and is the set of edge-color-preserving graph automorphisms. If the automorphism group
Aut (G) acts transitively on the flags of G, then Gisreflexible . (Thus, the flag graph of a regular
polytope is a reflexible maniplex.) In fact, the action of Aut ( G) on flags is free, and thus sharply
transitive (also called regular) when Gis a reflexible maniplex. When Gis any reflexible maniplex,
the automorphism group is an sggi. In particular, if we fix a base flag Φ, then for each i∈
{0, . . . , d −1}there is a unique automorphism ρithat sends Φ to Φi. We define the typeofGto be
the type of Aut ( G). More generally, if Gis a reflexible pre-maniplex, then Aut ( G) is a quotient of
an sggi; some generators may be trivial or some generators may coincide.
We will frequently make use of the following simple but fundamental fact: if Mis a reflexible
maniplex, then Conn ( M) is isomorphic to Aut ( M) in the natural way that sends generators to
generators; see [3, Thm. 2.1].
The smallest reflexible cover SRC (M) of a maniplex Mis the Cayley graph of the group
Conn ( M) on its standard set of generators, which is itself a reflexible maniplex. It is straight-
forward to adapt Proposition 3.16 from [15] to show that every other reflexible cover of Mis also
a cover of SRC ( M), and as a corollary that SRC ( FG(P)) is the flag graph of the unique mini-
mal regular cover of Pwhen Conn ( P) is a string C-group. Hence, we say that a pre-maniplex is
C-connected if its connection group is a string C-group.
By Lemma 2.1, elap-maps behave in most settings exactly like rap-maps of abstract polytopes,
particularly in settings where it is the connectivity of the flag graph that is central to the argument.
Consequently, it is straightforward to adapt many results from the literature to this setting, with
slight rewordings. Here is one important example.
Lemma 2.2 (Proposition 3.11 from [15]) .LetM,Nbe pre-maniplexes, let κ:M → N a covering
of pre-maniplexes. Then there exists an epimorphism κ: Conn ( M)→Conn ( N). Suppose also κ
maps a flag Λ′ofMto a flag ΛofN. Then
Stab Conn(M)Λ′κ⊆Stab Conn(N)Λ.
It is worth nothing the this group epimorphism is induced by the natural mapping of standard
generators to standard generators.
Given a polytope Pand a subgroup Hof Aut ( P), the quotient P/HofPbyHis the partially
ordered set whose elements are the orbits of the faces of Punder the action of Hwith the induced
partial order. The important things to note about such quotients is that while a quotient by a
group of automorphisms will frequently induce a covering of polytopes, this won’t always be the
case since the quotient object need not be a polytope (see [15, Sec. 2]). However, such a quotient
does induce a corresponding natural quotient of the flag graph of Pby the action of HonF(P),
and the resulting quotient of the edge-labeled flag graph will be a maniplex or pre-maniplex. An
example of the latter phenomenon occurs if adjacent flags in Pare identified in P/H. In particular,
semi-edges arise from graph automorphisms which swap the two flags on a proper edge of the flag
graph. We note that semi-edges are needed to preserve vertex degrees and the proper edge-coloring.
Now let us adapt Lemma 5.2 from [16].

Lemma 2.3. LetPbe an abstract polytope, H≤Aut(P). LetQ=P/Hand let
L={l∈Conn ( P) :∀Φ∈ F(P),∃h∈Hs.t.lΦ = Φ h}.
Then L◁Conn ( P)andConn ( P)/L∼=Conn ( Q).
Proof. LetLbe as above. Notice that the hin the definition of Lis allowed to depend on your
choice of flag Φ. Let l∈Landm∈Conn ( P),Φ∈ F(P). We claim that for each Φ ∈ F(P) there
exists h∈Hsuch that m−1lmΦ = Φ h. Note that by the definition of L, there exists h∈Hsuch
thatlmΦ = ( mΦ)h, som−1lmΦ =m−1mΦh= Φh, as desired.
Letκ:P → Q be the natural quotient map induced by H. By Lemma 2.2 the map κinduces
a surjective map κ: Conn ( P)→Conn ( Q). We claim that ker( κ) =L. Let Φ ∈ F(P). First, let
k∈ker(κ), then kΦH= ΦH, and so k∈L, thus ker( κ)≤L. Next, let l∈L, then there exists
h∈Hsuch that lΦ = Φ h, and so lΦH= (Φh)H= ΦH. Hence, l∈ker(κ), and L≤ker(κ). Hence
L◁Conn ( P) and Conn ( P)/L∼=Conn ( Q). □
Lemma 2.4. LetRbe an orientable regular polyhedron, and let γ∈Γ+(R)fix an incident vertex-
facet pair. Then γis the identity.
Proof. We first note that Γ+(R) preserves orientation and acts transitively on each orientation class
ofR. Let v, f, respectively, be our incident vertex-facet pair, and let Φ be a flag of Rcontaining
them, and, without loss of generality, let αibe the generators of Γ( R) associated with this choice
of base flag. Then we may express γas an element of Γ+(R) =⟨α0α1, α1α2⟩. By assumption γ
fixes vandf, and thus γ∈ ⟨α0, α1⟩ ∩ ⟨α1, α2⟩. Then, since Γ( R) is a string C-group, γ∈ ⟨α1⟩.
We note that the identity is the only element of ⟨α1⟩that preserves orientation, completing the
argument. □
2.5.Mixing. Suppose that MandNared-maniplexes (or indeed, pre-maniplexes), with base
flags Φ 0and Ψ 0, respectively. Consider a new graph whose nodes are pairs (Φ ,Ψ) with Φ a flag of
Mand Ψ a flag of N, and define (Φ ,Ψ)i= (Φi,Ψi). Then the mix of MwithN, denoted M ♢ N ,
is the (pre-)maniplex we obtain by taking the connected component of this graph that contains
(Φ0,Ψ0).
IfN(orM) is reflexible, then the graph we obtain has a single connected component, and
so in that case it is not necessary to specify base flags of MandN(see [2, Corollary 3.13]).
Furthermore, in this case, M ♢ N covers MandNand satisfies the following universal property:
any pre-maniplex that covers both MandNalso covers M ♢ N . Note that the mix of two
reflexible pre-maniplexes is itself reflexible.
Proposition 2.5. Suppose that MandRare pre-maniplexes, with Rreflexible. Then
SRC (M ♢ R )∼=SRC (M)♢ R.
Proof. LetL= SRC ( M ♢ R ). Then Lcovers M ♢ R and thus it covers MandR. Futhermore,
sinceLis reflexible, it must cover SRC ( M), and so it covers SRC ( M)♢ R.
In the other direction, if N= SRC ( M)♢ R, then Ncovers MandR, and so it covers M ♢ R .
SinceNis the mix of two reflexible pre-maniplexes, it is reflexible, and so it covers SRC ( M ♢ R ),
showing that L∼=N. □
3.Stratified Operations and Connection Groups
3.1.Stratification and Cover Preservation. Constructing a prism over a base maniplex is
an example of a broader class of operations called stratified operations introduced in [3]. The
connection group of the result of a stratified operation can be described nicely using the connection
group of the input. In this section, we will see how the connection group of a prism can be described
in terms of the connection group of the base.
REFLEXIBLE COVERS OF PRISMS 201
LetMddenote the family of maniplexes of rank d, and Wd= [∞, . . . ,∞] the universal string
Coxeter group of rank d. The group Wd=⟨w0. . . , w d−1⟩acts on the flags of any d-maniplex M,
where the action of each wican be identified with the corresponding generator riof the connection
group of M. Following [3] we consider a maniplex operation F:Mn→Mmto be stratified if there
is a set A(called the strata , and each element of Ais astratum ) such that
(a) If Ω is the set of flags of an n-maniplex M, then the set of flags of F(M) is a subset of A×Ω
such that the canonical projections into Aand Ω are surjective.
(b) Let S={w0, . . . , w m−1}be the set of generators of Wm; then Wmhas a well-defined action on
A, where we denote by σithe permutation of Ainduced by wi∈S.
(c) There is a function ϕ:A×S→Wnsuch that, for every maniplex Mand flag Φ, the action of
wionA×Ω is described by
wi(a,Φ) = ( σia, ϕ(a, w i)Φ).
Furthermore, if the set of flags of F(M) is all of A×Ω, then we say that Fisfully stratified . Fully
stratified operations are cover-preserving [3, Proposition 3.8]; that is to say, if Fis fully stratified,
andMcovers L, then F(M) covers F(L). Additionally, when examining connection groups,
fully stratified operations commute with the smallest reflexible cover operation [3, Theorem 3.9].
Formally, it follows from [3, Remark 2.3] that, if Fis fully stratified and Mis any maniplex, then
Conn ( F(M))∼=Conn (SRC ( F(M)))∼=Conn ( F(SRC ( M))).
Proposition 3.1. IfFis a stratified operation and Mis a maniplex, then Aut (M)≤Aut ( F(M)).
Proof. Given α∈Aut (M), we define α∈Aut ( F(M)) by ( a,Φ)α= (a,Φα). This is easily seen to
commute with the action of Wm, and thus it does define an automorphism. □
Remark 3.2.The definition of stratified operation, fully stratified operation, and so on, all apply
equally well to pre-maniplexes. Indeed, the essential feature of maniplexes in [3] is just the action
ofWdon maniplexes of rank d, and generalizing to pre-maniplexes is straightforward.
3.2.Orientability. A pre-maniplex is said to be orientable if it is a bipartite graph; otherwise
it is non-orientable . We note that orientable (or directly ) regular polytopes are orientable when
considered as pre-maniplexes. Since we consider a flag to be adjacent to itself whenever it is incident
to a semi-edge, an orientable pre-maniplex cannot have any semi-edges. The smallest orientable
pre-maniplex of rank dconsists of two flags, connected to each other with dedges with labels
0, . . . , d −1. We will denote this pre-maniplex by Gd.
Every non-orientable pre-maniplex Mhas a unique orientable double cover. We can obtain this
by mixing MwithGd(with dthe rank of M); see [18, p. 541], which describes the analogous
construction for maps. Note that if Mis orientable, then M ♢ G d∼=M. Thus, we will define
OC (M) asM ♢ G d, and OC ( M) is the minimal orientable cover of M.
We will use the following simple result.
Proposition 3.3. LetOC (M)be the orientable cover of a maniplex. Then OC is cover-preserving,
andSRC (OC (SRC ( M))) = SRC (OC ( M)).
Proof. Suppose that LandMare maniplexes of rank dsuch that Lcovers M. Note that OC ( L) =
L ♢ G d, which covers both LandGd. Since it covers L, it covers M, and since it covers MandGd,
it covers their mix, which is OC ( M). So OC ( L) covers OC ( M), and thus OC is cover-preserving.
Next we will show that SRC (OC (SRC ( M))) = SRC (OC ( M)). First, note that OC (SRC ( M))
is reflexible, and so the left side can be simplified to OC (SRC ( M)). Then by the definition of OC,
we want to show that
SRC (M)♢ G d= SRC ( M ♢ G d).
That follows from Proposition 2.5. □
202 GABE CUNNINGHAM, MARK MIXER, AND GORDON WILLIAMS
A reflexible maniplex is orientable if and only if the defining relators of its automorphism group
all have even length.
3.3.The Prism Operation. In [3, Theorem 6.1] it is shown that the products, including the
prisms, are fully stratified. Furthermore, in [7, Section 8.2], the connection group of a prism
is explicitly described. Strictly speaking, this connection group was defined for a prism over a
polytope, but the same definition can be used to define a prism over a general pre-maniplex. (See
also Section 4 in [11].) This description will also show that the prism operation is fully stratified,
where the exact permutations σiand the function ϕcan be seen from their description. In [7,
Section 8.2] the authors represent each flag in the prism as a triple Ψ = (Λ , b,Φ) where Λ is either
one of the two flags of the rank 1 polytope, bis one of the elements eiwith i∈ {1,2, . . . , d + 1},
and Φ is a flag in the base*. To match our notation for stratified operations, we can think of
each pair [Λ , b] as representing a stratum. Thus we will have 2( d+ 1) strata, and can construct
si(a,Φ) = si([Λ, b],Φ), in the notation of stratified operations, as si(Λ, b,Φ) in the notation of [7].
Let⟨s0, . . . , s d⟩be the connection group of a prism, ⟨r0, . . . , r d−1⟩be the connection group of the
base. The generators of the connection group of the prism are as follows:
(1) s0([Λ, b],Φ) =(
([Λ, b], r0Φ),ifb̸=e1,
([Λ0, b],Φ),ifb=e1.
Fori >0 the connections are as follows:
(2) si([Λ, b],Φ) =

([Λ, ei+1],Φ) if b=ei
([Λ, ei],Φ) if b=ei+1
([Λ, b], ri−1Φ) if b∈ {e1, . . . , e i−1}
([Λ, b], riΦ) if b∈ {ei+2, . . . , e d+1}.
Thus the connection group of a prism over a pre-maniplex can be seen as an imprimitive group
with 2 d+ 2 blocks, and it can be embedded in a wreath product. In particular, the connection
group acts on the strata according to the pre-maniplex shown in Figure 1. (Compare to Figure 5
in [11].) To simplify our notation, fix our choice for the variable Λ to be the flag λ, and we will
label the strata, which correspond to pairs [Λ , b], using the numbers 1 through 2 d+ 2.

Figure 1. The pre-maniplex determined by the action of a prism on strata. The
semi-edges, which make the graph regular, are not shown for simplicity. Indices
for the strata are listed below the stratum in the figure, e.g., [ λ, e2] has label d.
*For ease of reading, we have changed the order of the triple, making the flag in the base come after the other
information that determines the stratum. In [7] each flag is actually written as a triple Ψ = (Φ ,Λ, b).
REFLEXIBLE COVERS OF PRISMS 203
Using the notation of [16], we can now represent the connection group of a prism over a 3-maniplex
Bas a subgroup of S8⋉(Conn ( B))8=S8≀Conn ( B). (Note that we are choosing to reverse the usual
ordering of the groups in the wreath product to respect the side of action usually associated with the
connection group.) To do this we consider a base flag Φ of P, and we may then associate the posi-
tions in our representation with the sequence of flags Φ ,Φ3,Φ32,Φ321,Φ3210,Φ32101,Φ321012,Φ3210123.
So if Conn ( B) =⟨r0, r1, r2⟩with identity element e, then Conn ( P) =⟨s0, . . . , s 3⟩will have gener-
ators
s0:= ((4 ,5),[r0, r0, r0, e, e, r 0, r0, r0]),
s1:= ((3 ,4)(5,6),[r1, r1, e, e, e, e, r 1, r1]),
s2:= ((2 ,3)(6,7),[r2, e, e, r 1, r1, e, e, r 2]),
s3:= ((1 ,2)(7,8),[e, e, r 2, r2, r2, r2, e, e]).
If we quotient Conn ( P) by the normal subgroup of elements which fix each block setwise, we get
a group Bwhich gives the action of Conn ( P) on these 8 blocks. Let B=⟨b0, b1, b2, b3⟩where the
generators are the images of the generators of Conn ( P) under the quotient map. Then we have
the following permutation representation for B:
b0= (4,5), b1= (3,4)(5,6), b2= (2,3)(6,7), b3= (1,2)(7,8).
Due to the symmetry in the terms in (Conn ( B))8, we will usually denote elements in this repre-
sentation without the redundant terms and with a doubled right brace, e.g.,
s2:= ((2 ,3)(6,7),[r2, e, e, r 1K).
An immediate observation is that
(s0s1)4= (() ,[(r0r1)4,(r0r1)4, e, e K),
(s1s2)3= (() ,[(r1r2)3, e, e, e K), (3)
(s2s3)3= (() ,[e, e, e, (r1r2)3K).
4.Properties of the Connection Groups of Prisms of Rank 4
In this section we provide some facts about the connection groups of prisms with a special focus
on prisms over 3-maniplexes.
Proposition 4.1. Let⟨s0, . . . , s 3⟩be the connection group of a rank 4 prism P. Let Kbe the
normal subgroup of ⟨s1, s2, s3⟩that fixes the eight blocks setwise. Then Kis the normal closure of
⟨(s1s2)3,(s2s3)3⟩in⟨s1, s2, s3⟩.
Proof. Equation (3) shows that ( s1s2)3and ( s2s3)3fix all blocks, and so Kcontains their normal
closure. Now, let π:⟨s1, s2, s3⟩ →[3,3] be projection in the first coordinate. In other words, π(si)
gives the action of sion blocks, so that K= ker π. Now, let W=⟨w1, w2, w3⟩be the universal
Coxeter group [ ∞,∞]. Then there is a group epimorphism from Wto⟨s1, s2, s3⟩that sends each
witosi. Furthermore, Wcovers [3 ,3], and the kernel of this cover is the normal closure of ( s1s2)3
and ( s2s3)3inW. Then Kis the image of that kernel in ⟨s1, s2, s3⟩, and the result follows. □
Corollary 4.2. Let⟨s0, . . . , s 3⟩be the connection group of a rank 4 prism P, and let ⟨r0, r1, r2⟩be
the connection group of its base. Let Kbe the normal subgroup of ⟨s1, s2, s3⟩that fixes the eight
blocks setwise. Then
K={((),[(r1r2)3i1,(r1r2)3i2,(r1r2)3i3,(r1r2)3i4K) :i1, i2, i3, i4∈Z}.
204 GABE CUNNINGHAM, MARK MIXER, AND GORDON WILLIAMS
Proof. LetSbe the set (in fact, subgroup) on the right. First, note that conjugation by s1,s2, and
s3all fix S, and so Sis a normal subgroup of ⟨s1, s2, s3⟩that contains ( s1s2)3and ( s2s3)3. Thus S
contains K. Now, we have
(s1s2)3= (() ,[(r1r2)3, e, e, e K)
((s1s2)3)s3= (() ,[e,(r1r2)3, e, e K)
((s2s3)3)s1= (() ,[e, e,(r1r2)3, eK)
(s2s3)3= (() ,[e, e, e, (r1r2)3K).
Since Kis generated by ( s1s2)3and ( s2s3)3and their conjugates, this shows that Kcontains S,
proving that they are equal. □
For what follows, we will be using the pre-maniplex Qdetermined by the connection group with
generators
ρ0:= (1 ,3)(2,4)(5,6)(7,8)(9,10)(11 ,12)(13 ,14)(15 ,16),
ρ1:= (1 ,5)(2,6)(3,7)(4,8)(9,10)(11 ,12)(13 ,14)(15 ,16),
ρ2:= (1 ,2)(3,4)(5,9)(6,10)(7 ,11)(8 ,12)(13 ,14)(15 ,16),
ρ3:= (1 ,2)(3,4)(5,6)(7,8)(9,13)(10 ,14)(11 ,15)(12 ,16);
which turns out to be precisely the prism over the pre-maniplex G3with connection group
Conn ( G3) =⟨(1,2),(1,2),(1,2)⟩;
in this interpretation, the two facets isomorphic to G3correspond to the pairs of vertices {13,14}
and{15,16}. It is easily verified computationally that Conn ( Q) is a string C-group. Additionally,
as will be seen in Proposition 4.7, the smallest reflexible cover of Prism( G3) is the 4-cube. We note
that while Conn ( Q)∼=[4,3,3], this does not represent the usual action of [4 ,3,3] on the 16 vertices
of the 4-cube. In that action there exists a vertex stabilized by three of the four generators of the
automorphism group of the 4-cube.
Theorem 4.3. Prisms over orientable regular polyhedra are C-connected. In other words, if B
is an orientable regular polyhedron, and P= Prism ( B), then Conn ( P)is a string C-group, and
SRC (P)is a polytope.
Proof. Let Γ = ⟨ρ0, ρ1, ρ2⟩= Aut ( B) in terms of the usual generators for a regular polyhedron, and
let Γ+be the rotation subgroup of Γ. By Proposition 3.1, we can naturally embed Γ+into Aut ( P);
letHdenote the image of this embedding. Let Lbe defined as in Lemma 2.3 for this group H.
We first note that, as shown in [7, Theorem A], Pis itself a polytope. Since Bis an orientable
polyhedron, its flag graph is bipartite, and the action of Γ+on the flags preserves the partition and
acts transitively on the flags in each part, hence B/Γ+∼=G3as pre-maniplexes. Let us extend the
coloring of Bto a coloring of Pby coloring each flag ( a,Φ) with the color of Φ. Then it isn’t hard
to see that P/H∼=Qsince the action of Hwill identify flags in the same stratum of the same color,
and thus Conn ( Q)∼=Conn ( P)/Lby Lemma 2.3. Let κbe the quotient map from Lemma 2.3.
Let{r0, r1, r2, r3}be the canonical generators of C= Conn ( P). Observe that since Pis a
polytope, that the groups C0=⟨r1, r2, r3⟩andC3=⟨r0, r1, r2⟩are string C-groups by Proposition
5.1 of [16]. Thus by [13, Proposition 2E16], to show that Cis a string C-group it suffices to show
thatC0∩C3=⟨r1, r2⟩.
Letγ∈C0∩C3, and let si:=riκ. Then γκ∈(C0∩C3)κ. Since Conn ( Q) is a string C-group,
it follows that ( C0∩C3)κ⊆C0κ∩C3κ=⟨s1, s2⟩=⟨r1, r2⟩κ. Thus γ∈ ⟨r1, r2⟩L, i.e., γ=slfor
some s∈ ⟨r1, r2⟩andl∈L. Since γ∈C0∩C3fixes every vertex and facet of P, so does l=s−1γ.
We consider now the action of lon the flags of P. Let Φ be a flag of P, and let v, fbe the incident
vertex and facet of Φ.
REFLEXIBLE COVERS OF PRISMS 205
If Φ is a flag in a prismatic facet of P, then lΦ = Φ hfor some h∈Hby the definition of L.
We claim his the identity element. Since lfixes vandf,hmust fix the corresponding vertex and
2-face of B, but since Bis a polytope, Lemma 2.4 implies that the only element of hthat does this
is the identity element, hence lΦ = Φ.
Now, consider the action of lon the eight blocks (as in Figure 1). The argument above shows
that it acts trivially on blocks 2 through 7. Furthermore, since l∈C3, inspection of the action
on blocks shows that lfixes blocks 1 and 8 setwise. So lfixes all of the blocks. Since l∈C0as
well, Corollary 4.2 implies that lacts on block 1 (and 8) like an automorphism ( ρ1ρ2)3kfor some
k. Since lalso fixes blocks 2-7, it follows that lis a power of
(s1s2)3= (() ,[(r1r2)3, e, e, e K).
Thus, l∈ ⟨r1, r2⟩. From this we conclude that γmay be represented as a product of elements in
⟨r1, r2⟩. Therefore Conn ( P) is a string C-group and SRC ( P) is a polytope.
□
Remark 4.4.The fact that Bwas a polyhedron, and not just an orientable and reflexible 3-maniplex
is important. In fact there are prisms over orientable and reflexible 3-maniplexes that do not have
string C connection groups. For instance consider the reflexible maniplex Mwith automorphism
group
⟨ρ0, ρ1, ρ2|ρ2
0=ρ2
1=ρ2
2= (ρ0ρ1)8= (ρ1ρ2)6= (ρ0ρ2)2= (ρ0ρ1)4(ρ1ρ2)3= 1⟩.
This maniplex is not a polytope; it fails the diamond condition, as for each incident vertex and
facet, there are four edges incident with both. However, it is orientable as all the relators have even
length in the generators. In this example both ρ1and ( ρ0ρ1)4will fix an incident vertex and facet
pair. However ( ρ0ρ1)4is in Γ+(M) and thus Lemma 2.4 will not hold.
Remark 4.5.If the base were non-orientable, the pre-maniplex P/His determined by the connection
group with generators ρ0:= (1 ,2), ρ1:= (1 ,3)(2,4), ρ2:= (3 ,5)(4,6), ρ3:= (5 ,7)(6,8).
Lemma 4.6. LetMbe a reflexible 3-maniplex, and let P=Prism (M)be the prism with Mas a
base. Then the smallest reflexible cover of Pcovers the regular 4-cube, and SRC (P)♢Cube(4) =
SRC (P).
Proof. LetC= Conn ( P). In Section 3.3 we saw that Ccan be represented as a subgroup of the
imprimitive wreath product, where Cacts with 8 blocks of imprimitivity on the flags, and that
when we quotient Cby the normal subgroup of elements which fix each block setwise, we get a
group Bwhich gives the action of Con these 8 blocks with the following generators.
b0= (4,5), b1= (3,4)(5,6), b2= (2,3)(6,7), b3= (1,2)(7,8);
As this is an sggi of type {4,3,3}and has order 384, this can be shown to be equivalent to the
automorphism group of the 4-cube acting faithfully on its 8 facets.
Since the connection group of the regular 4-cube is isomorphic to the automorphism group, we
can conclude that C= Conn ( P)↘Conn (Cube(4)) and thus SRC ( P)♢Cube(4) = SRC ( P) (by
Lemma 5.3 of [15]). □
Proposition 4.7. IfGdis the orientable reflexible rank dpre-maniplex with two flags, then
Prism ( Gd)is orientable, and the smallest reflexible cover of Prism ( Gd)is the cube of rank d+ 1.
Proof. We first note that the Conn ( Gd) =⟨(1,2), . . . , (1,2)⟩. From Equations (1) and (2), since Gd
has only two flags, it is straightforward to check that |s0s1|= 4,and that |sisi+1|= 3 for i >0.
To be even more pedantic: his an element of the automorphism group Γ, which acts freely on B. The only
non-trivial element of Γ that fixes an incident vertex and 2-face is ρ1̸∈H.
206 GABE CUNNINGHAM, MARK MIXER, AND GORDON WILLIAMS
For instance, let ϕbe either of the two flags in the base pre-maniplex Gdandλbe either of the two
flags in the rank 1 polytope. Then we get one 8-cycle of flags when alternately applying s0ands1:
(([λ, e2], ϕ),([λ, e2], ϕ0),([λ, e1], ϕ0),([λ0, e1], ϕ0),([λ0, e2], ϕ0),([λ0, e2], ϕ),([λ0, e1], ϕ),([λ, e1], ϕ)).
Thus s0s1has order 4 when acting on any of these 8 flags. Additionally s0s1acts like identity
on any flags not in this 8-cycle. The calculation for |sisi+1|= 3 for i >0 is similar.
Thus Conn (Prism ( Gd)) satisfies all the relations of the Coxeter group [4 ,3, . . . , 3]. Additionally
|s0s1. . . s d|= 2d+ 2 and thus Conn (Prism ( Gd)) does not satisfy the relations of the connection
group of the hemi-cube (which satisfies |s0s1. . . s d|=d+ 1 instead). In particular, using Figure 1,
we see that the action of s0s1···sdon the strata is given by:
s0s1···sd= (1,2, . . . , d + 1,2d+ 2,2d+ 1, . . . , d + 2).
Therefore Prism ( Gd) is orientable and the smallest reflexible cover of Prism ( Gd) is the cube of rank
d+ 1.
□
We will now work to show that the conclusion of Theorem 4.3 works even if the base is non-
orientable.
Lemma 4.8. LetMbe a reflexible d-maniplex. Then Prism (OC ( M))∼=OC (Prism ( M)).
Proof. First, note that if Mis orientable, then OC ( M)∼=M. Furthermore, Prism ( M) is ori-
entable. Thus the result is clear in this case. So let us suppose that Mis non-orientable.
Let us consider the flags of Prism (OC ( M)). First, the flags of OC ( M) can be seen as pairs
(Φ, x) with Φ a flag of Mandx∈ {− 1,1}. Then Prism (OC ( M)) consists of pairs ( a,(Φ, x)), with
a∈ {1,2, . . . , 2d+ 2}representing the stratum in the definition of Prism as a stratified operation,
as shown in Figure 1. Similarly, we find that the flags of OC (Prism ( M)) can be represented as
((a,Φ), x). Note that since Mis non-orientable, so is Prism ( M), so every pair of aand Φ appears
with every x. Furthermore, since Prism is fully stratified, every Φ occurs with every a.
We claim that the function fthat sends each ( a,(Φ, x)) to (( a,Φ),(−1)a+1x) is an elap-map. If
we can show that, then it is clear that it is one-to-one since both sides consist of all triples of a, Φ,
andx.
First, note that in the definition of the Prism operation, each sieither fixes the stratum aor
fixes the flag Φ. Let us consider an arbitrary flag ( a,(Φ, x)). Suppose that ais odd; the case with
aeven is similar. If sifixes a, then
(a,(Φ, x))i= (a,(Φ, x)j) = (a,(Φj,−x))
for some jdepending only on aandi. Similarly,
((a,Φ), x)i= ((a,Φ)i,−x) = (( a,Φj),−x).
Note that fsends ( a,(Φj,−x)) to (( a,Φj),−x), as it is supposed to. Similarly, if sisends atoai
while fixing Φ, then
(a,(Φ, x))i= (ai,(Φ, x))
while
((a,Φ), x)i= ((a,Φ)i,−x) = (( ai,Φ),−x).
We note that whenever ai̸=a, then aihas opposite parity from a. Again, fsends ( ai,(Φ, x)) to
((ai,Φ),−x) as it should. Thus fpreserves adjacency and edge-labels, completing the proof. □
Lemma 4.9. LetMbe a non-orientable reflexible 3-maniplex. Then
SRC (Prism ( M)) = SRC (Prism (OC ( M))).
REFLEXIBLE COVERS OF PRISMS 207
Proof. LetPbe the prism with base M, and let Cbe the 4-cube. Since SRC (Prism (OC ( M)))
covers SRC ( P), it suffices to show that SRC ( P) covers SRC (Prism (OC ( M))).
SinceCis orientable, SRC ( P)♢ Cis also orientable. Thus SRC ( P)♢ Ccovers OC (SRC ( P)).
Then due to the fact that SRC ( P)♢ Cis reflexible, it also covers SRC (OC (SRC ( P))). By Propo-
sition 3.3, SRC (OC ( P)) = SRC (OC (SRC ( P))). Therefore, SRC ( P)♢ Ccovers SRC (OC ( P)).
Applying Lemma 4.6 and Lemma 4.8 we can conclude that SRC ( P) covers
SRC (Prism (OC ( M))).
□
Theorem 4.10. Prisms over polyhedra are C-connected. In other words, if Bis a polyhedron, and
P= Prism ( B), then Conn ( P)is a string C-group, and SRC (P)is a polytope.
Proof. First, Theorem 4.3 proves the case where Bis orientable and reflexible, and combined with
Lemma 4.9, this implies that the result holds for all reflexible polyhedra. Moreover, by [15, Prop.
6.1] Conn ( B) is a string C-group for all polyhedra B; in other words, Conn ( B) = Conn ( R) where
R= SRC ( B). Since the prism operation is connection preserving, Conn ( P) = Conn (Prism ( R)),
completing the proof. □
5.Open Problems
As mentioned in the introduction, there are numerous examples of 4-polytopes Pfor which
Conn (Prism ( P)) is not a string C-group. In fact, the role of orientability in the classification of
which polytopes of rank 4 and higher is unclear since the universal polytope Pof type {3,3,2}
is orientable, as is {3,6,4} ∗144§, and yet Prism ( P) has a smallest reflexible cover that is not
polytopal in both cases.
Question 5.1. For which polytopes Pof rank d≥4is the smallest reflexible cover of Prism ( P)a
regular polytope?
Lemmas 4.6, 4.8, and 4.9 all generalize to higher ranks (using Proposition 4.7). In fact, Lemma 4.6
suggests another possibility; namely that being able to form a C-connected prism over a polytope
is related to the structure of the mix of the polytope with the cube. Testing of a wide range of
examples in various ranks in GAP [5] with the package RAMP [1] suggests the following conjecture.
Conjecture 5.2. LetPbe a d-polytope. Then Prism ( P)is C-connected iff P ♢ Cube( d)is C-
connected.
Note that a number of possible weakenings of the conjecture above fail. For example, changing
both instances of ‘C-connected’ to ‘polytopal’ fails; since while all prisms over polytopes are poly-
topal, there are polytopes (such as the 4-cross-polytope) that have a non-polytopal mix with the
4-cube.
