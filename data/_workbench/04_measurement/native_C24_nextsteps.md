# Native C24 next steps (self-directed)

Priority analyses:
1) Reconstruct native C24 coherence observables tied to z <-> z+3 parity and correlate with winners/sensors.
2) Derive the native projectors directly from W33 rays + u_- and verify consistency with the full-grid winners.
3) Identify which canonical lines flip sign (mean_delta) between native and canonical models.
