# Hyperplane translation stabilizer (size 48) structure clue

Stabilizer order distribution computed for the idx27=0 stabilizer:
- {1:1, 2:19, 3:8, 4:12, 6:8}

This distribution matches S4 × Z2 exactly:
- S4 has orders {1:1, 2:9, 3:8, 4:6}.
- Multiplying by Z2 yields {1:1, 2:19, 3:8, 4:12, 6:8}.

By contrast, GL(2,3) contains order‑8 elements and does not match this distribution.
So the linear stabilizer in the 1296 closure is strongly consistent with S4 × Z2 (tetrahedral symmetry plus a central inversion).
