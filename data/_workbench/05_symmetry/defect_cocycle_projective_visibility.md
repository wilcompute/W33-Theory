# Defect cocycle visibility vs projective images

- total signatures: 3
- signatures with e*: 1
- e* signature: ('sec0_m0', 'sec1_m0', 'sec2_m0', 'sec3_m0') with counts {'e': 63, 'e*': 4}
- signatures unique to e*: 0

Notes:
- e* edges share the same projective image signature as a subset of e edges (projectively trivial).
- Any symmetry acting only on projective classes cannot distinguish e* from e; the cocycle is invisible at that layer.
