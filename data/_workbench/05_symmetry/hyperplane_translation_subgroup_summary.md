# Hyperplane translation subgroup (size 27)

All 27 translations t with t0-t1-t2+t3=0 are present in the 1296 closure.

- translation_count: 27
- stabilizer_size (idx27=0): 48
- stabilizer_order_distribution: {1: 1, 2: 19, 3: 8, 4: 12, 6: 8}

This gives 1296 = 27 * 48 with a regular translation subgroup.
See `hyperplane_translation_subgroup.csv` for the explicit translations, `hyperplane_translation_stabilizer_structure.md` for the S4×Z2 match, and `hyperplane_translation_stabilizer_matrices_summary.md` for the linear action matrices.
