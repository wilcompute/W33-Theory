# Stabilizer -> S4×Z2 on 4 translation-pairs

- elements: 48
- sign counts: {-1: 24, 1: 24} (sign=-1 is central inversion)
- unique perms: 24

Permutation order distribution (S4 part):
- {1: 2, 2: 18, 3: 16, 4: 12}

Notes:
- The permutation counts are exactly 2×S4 order counts, confirming the S4×Z2 split.
- The central inversion corresponds to the -I matrix (elem_index=2 in `hyperplane_translation_stabilizer_matrices.csv`).
