# Transport-shifted hyperplane quartets (c=(1,0,0,0))

Each hyperplane quartet (sum=1) is shifted by a0 -> a0 + k for k=1,2 to form sum=2 and sum=0 sets.

- sum=0: n=27, mean_pred=0.007570, min_pred=0.002105, max_pred=0.016791
- sum=1: n=27, mean_pred=0.008268, min_pred=0.000462, max_pred=0.019259
- sum=2: n=27, mean_pred=0.008965, min_pred=0.001254, max_pred=0.016717
