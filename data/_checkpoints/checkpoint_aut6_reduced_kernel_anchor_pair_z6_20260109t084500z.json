    "This aut=6 kernel is the reduced analogue of the N12_58 story: a Z3 action (tau) with distinguished fixed anchors, and a Z2 action that exchanges the anchors, combining to a Z6 clock on the anchor subsystem.",
    "Unlike N12_58, there is no V4 refinement visible in the missing-triangle orbit structure; the natural sector layer is Z2 (the swapped pair) rather than Z2\u00d7Z2.",
    "These aut=6 manifolds are strong candidates for a 'subkernel' embedding into the N12_58 kernel by restricting to a single defect-family bit and its associated Z3."
