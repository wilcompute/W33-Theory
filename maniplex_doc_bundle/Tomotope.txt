The tomotope is notable in that its monodromy group does not satisfy the intersection condition and thus is not an abstract polytope. As a result the tomotope has infinitely many minimal regular covers, all of type {3,12,4}. It does not satisfy the intersection condition and thus is not a C-group. As a result the minimal regular cover of the tomotope is not an abstract regular polytope (but rather a maniplex).


The automorphism group of the tomotope is the permutation group generated by:

p0 = (5,10)(6,9)(7,12)(8,11)
p1 = (1,6)(2,5)(3,8)(4,7)
p2 = (5,9)(6,10)(7,11)(8,12)
p3 = (5,8)(6,7)(9,12)(10,11)
