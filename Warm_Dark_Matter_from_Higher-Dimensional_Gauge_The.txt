Abstract: Warm dark matter particles with masses in the keV range have been linked with the large
group representations in gauge theories through a high number of species at decoupling. In this
paper, we address WDM fermionic degrees of freedom from such representations. Bridging higher-
dimensional particle physics theories with cosmology studies and astrophysical observations, our
approach is two-folded, i.e., it includes realistic models from higher-dimensional representations and
constraints from simulations tested against observations. Starting with superalgebras in exceptional
periodicity theories, we discuss several symmetry reductions and we consider several representations
that accommodate a high number of degrees of freedom. We isolate a model that naturally accommo-
dates both the standard model representation and the fermionic dark matter in agreement with both
large and small-scale constraints. This model considers an intersection of branes in D = 27 + 3 in a
manner that provides the degrees of freedom for the standard model on one hand and 2048 fermionic
degrees of freedom for dark matter, corresponding to a∼2 keV particle mass, on the other. In this
context, we discuss the theoretical implications and the observable predictions.

1. Introduction
In the past decade, having been thoroughly tested against the data from observations,
the cold dark matter (CDM) model has encountered difﬁculties in explaining these data and
has proved to be inconsistent with the observations under several aspects. Besides the two
initial concerns—the large cores in galaxies and the small number of satellites—that may
or may not be reconciled by introducing ﬁnely tuned baryonic processes in the simulations,
there are several other points of concern at both small and large scales, e.g., the fact that the
population of dwarf galaxies in voids is in contradiction with the predictions from CDM
simulations [1–3]; the failure to replicate, in CDM simulations, the high number of pure
bulgeless galaxies observed and the low number of galaxy mergers [4,5]; the formation and
growth of supermassive black holes in agreement with observed distributions [6]; and the
recent detection of high-redshift quasars [7].
WDM scenarios with particles in the keV range are gaining ground in explaining
some of these discrepancies and many studies show the advantages that a keV dark matter
model presents in explaining the observations at both small and large scales [8–18]. A keV
WDM particle, for example, can explain the existence of cores in galaxies of varied masses,
from dwarf galaxies to spirals, when considering the quantum Fermi pressure of the
particles [12–14]. Moreover, while, for spiral galaxies, in an attempt to reconcile the CDM
model with observations, the presence of the cores has been attributed to the stars and
gas concentration at the center of galaxies—tentatively described by adding baryonic
components in the simulations, with different studies showing different results, sometimes
contradictory (e.g., [19,20])—for dwarf galaxies, which are dark matter dominated, this
cannot be the case.

Furthermore, in WDM models with keV particles, stars can form early on inside the
ﬁlaments, as shown in unparalleled high-resolution simulations [21] and could provide
the seeds for the early formation of black holes, predictions that could be tested with more
such high-resolution simulation studies.
Given the challenges that the CDM is facing and in the absence of a successful experi-
mental detection of a CDM particle candidate, studies of warm dark matter models are
highly justiﬁed both from the theoretical and numerical perspectives.
From the point of view of particle physics, the theoretical models that predict candi-
dates for the generically called ‘warm dark matter’ are more varied than those for CDM,
with different production mechanisms that translate into several intrinsic properties of
the dark matter particles, reviewed in [22]. The consensus to what these particles have in
common is that they possess an astronomically signiﬁcant free streaming length. The free
streaming length implies a cutoff in the power spectrum and a non-zero velocity disper-
sion. The value for these ‘quantities’ is dictated by the particular model and production
mechanism and it gives a certain mass for the considered particle. In [16,17], several WDM
particle models and their assumptions have been re-examined, showing how strongly
model-dependent their properties are and, consequently, how weak the constraints on the
particle mass from the over-simpliﬁed simulations are.
Therefore, the catch comes from the freedom WDM provides in terms of the particle
candidates that are theorized in this category, mainly in the mass-velocity correspondence.
Since, in reality, we can only constrain, with observations and simulations, the velocity
dispersion of the particle and not the mass, other particle physics constraints have to be
considered in the absence of detection experimental results.
A particular model that has been extensively used in warm dark matter simulations
is the one described in [ 23], which implies a much higher number of degrees of free-
dom at decoupling than for the standard model and its supersymmetric extensions [24].
As hinted in [ 23], this would be possible in larger gauge groups, especially those with
extra dimensions.
Several studies have looked at larger gauge group representations in relation to dark
matter [25–29], but none that would explain the high number of degrees of freedom. In the
context of the so-called exceptional super Yang Mills theories, large group representations
that could allow this high number to be reached have been explored [30,31]. In this paper,
we revise these results and attempt to develop and isolate models that would produce the
required high number of degrees of freedom at decoupling, while preserving the standard
model representations. We found that these representations favor 2048 fermionic degrees
of freedom at decoupling, which corresponds to a∼2 keV particle, which happens to be in
agreement with observations.
In Section 2, we review the warm dark matter model requirement of such high degrees
of freedom. In Section 3, we introduce the algebras with higher dimensional spinors
and discuss several reductions in the context of exceptional periodicity. In Section 4, we
discuss the WDM and SM disentanglement through braneworld intersections, isolating a
mechanism through which SM degrees of freedom are isolated from WDM ones and WDM
becomes neutral under the photon gauging the electromagnetic U(1). Our conclusions are
summarized in Section 5.
2. keV WDM from Higher-Dimensional Gauge Theories
Within the WDM scenario, several models with various particle production mecha-
nisms and various properties have been previously studied. We can distinguish between
thermally produced neutrinos and those coming from a non-resonant production mecha-
nism [32–36] for particles in the eV–hundreds keV range that do not decay. More complex
models that consider decay [37] and re-thermalization [38] have also been considered as
well as quantum semi-degenerate particles with a non-negligible chemical potential [16].
However, in numerical simulations, the varied models are oversimpliﬁed, often using
a ‘cutoff’ in the power spectrum as the only parameter that distinguishes WDM from CDM

particles, as reviewed in [39]. The model most favored by simulation studies for a thermal
relic WDM particle, which provides this ‘cutoff’ mass-velocity, is the one described in [23].
Below, we discuss this model, its assumptions and its implications.
WDM Degrees of Freedom
The particle assumed in [ 23] is a thermal relic particle that decouples while still
relativistic, but, by equality, is nonrelativistic. The streaming speed at equality vs/c ∝
TX/mX, where the effective temperature TX varies inversely with the scale factor. In
order to have a streaming speed that is low enough to keep up with the CDM success
at large scales—meaning, the formation of structures as an early enough redshift and
within the observable mass scales for halos—the decrease in the effective temperature is
suggested [23]. If the particle decouples with thermal abundance, ρX ∝ T3
XmX must be
held ﬁxed. Therefore, to obtain a reasonable reduction in velocity, one needs to decrease
the temperature and increase the mass. One way the reduction in temperature can be
realized is through increasing the number of the degrees of freedom at decoupling. The
example given in [23] assumes a reduction in TX of∼4 and an increase in mass of 43, thus
corresponding to 688 degrees of freedom. However, for 1 keV , the number of degrees
of freedom is higher and this is usually what is indirectly used in simulations when the
velocity of the WDM particle is introduced, as shown in [16,17].
Below, we remind the derivation in [23] and the discussion in [16]. As recalled in [23]
(see [23] Appendix A for a detailed derivation and [16] for a detailed assessment of that
derivation), for a thermal relict particle X that decouples when relativistic, the abundance
nX relative to photons is
nX

2 , (1)
where gdec is the number of relativistic species present at decoupling—degrees of freedom—
and gX is the number of spin states of the particle. Assuming that the distribution function
scales as the non-thermal distribution (exp(v/v0) + 1)−1, for a redshift z, the velocity v0
(in Equation (A3) [23]) is given,
v0(z)

Therefore, for an mX = 1 keV particle, considering ΩX = 0.3 as in [23], we have the
following formula for the velocity:
v0(z)
1 + z≈ 0.12
( 1

that gives gdec≈ 1000 (gX/1.5)1/3 for a 1 keV particle.
This large value for the number of degrees of freedom at decoupling is much higher
than the value for the standard model, ∼107, and even the supersymmetric extension,
∼229 [24]. Other studies arbitrarily choose, in their analyses, a much more conservative
value for the number of degrees of freedom of the WDM particle candidates, i.e., ∼150
for a massive neutrino [24];∼100 for right-handed neutrinos that would decouple before
the electro-weak phase transition [ 40]. The number of degrees of freedom scales with
the mass of the particle therefore a higher mass would correspond to a higher number of
degrees of freedom (and a stronger decrease in temperature). Since this value is correlated
to the mass–velocity correspondence that dictates the behavior of the WDM particle and its

inﬂuence on the structure formation and evolution, we study the theoretical models where
such a large number of degrees of freedom can be achieved.
While the authors in [23] do hint at larger group representations with extra dimensions
in relation to the high gdec number, they also mention that entropy-producing processes
that take place after the decoupling of the particle can mimic an increase in gdec. Indeed,
trying to avoid such large group representations, [22,41–43] discuss the entropy generation
by the out-of-equilibrium decay of heavier particles, which would allow the number of
degrees of freedom of the keV particle to be similar to that used for active neutrinos [41].
Self-interactions as a possible way to reduce the number densities by self-annihilations
are also discussed in [ 44]. However, in this paper, we look at the large gauge group
representations that would naturally produce this high number of degrees of freedom,
starting with the symmetry reductions in algebras with higher-dimensional spinors in
exceptional periodicity theories.
3. Algebras with Higher-Dimensional Spinors
A class of algebras involving higher-dimensional spinors is studied in the so-called
exceptional super Yang–Mills (ESYM) theories, ﬁrstly discussed in [30,31], in which higher-
dimensional theories [45–50] beyond string/M-theory [51,52] have been considered and
extended, also in relation to exceptional periodicity (EP) algebras [53–55]. In this section, we
provide various branchings of these algebras with a number of spinor degrees of freedom
ofO(103). Here, we discuss the symmetry reductions along the worldvolume (WV) of
p-branes, which centrally extend the underlying chiral superalgebra and the reductions
that follow the so-called Magic Star structure—named so in [ 53] after the star polygon
geometric shape—of the corresponding EP algebra.
3.1. Superalgebra in 17 + 1 and 9-Brane WV Reduction
One of the simplest examples is based on the (1, 0) superalgebra obtained by setting
n = 1 in Equation (3.5) of [30], namely, the chiral superalgebra of ESYM in D = s + t =
17 + 1 space–time dimensions, whose central extensions are given by the r.h.s. of the
anticommutator
{
Qα, Qβ
}
= (γµ )αβ Pµ + (γµ 1...µ 5 )αβ Zµ 1...µ 5 + (γµ 1...µ 9 )αβ Zµ 1...µ 9, (5)
namely, by a 1-brane (fundamental string), an electric 5-brane and its dual, a magnetic
9-brane. The corresponding EP 3-graded algebra, whose semisimple, 0-graded part yields
the homogeneous Lorentz algebra of 17 + 1 space–time, is obtained by setting n = 1 in
(II.14) of [55], namely,
e(1)
6(−26) := 256′
−1⊕ (so17,1⊕ R)0⊕ 2561, (6)
where 256 and 256′, respectively, denote the Majorana–Weyl (MW) semispinor in17 + 1
dimensions and its conjugate (note that the EP leveln is understood with +1 in [30], namely,
the ﬁrst non-trivial level of EP is given by n = 2 therein). It should be remarked that, when
the spinors are interpreted as Abelian translational generators, the non-negatively graded
part of the EP algebra e(1)
6(−26) (6) yields the Lie algebra of the global isometry group of the
homogeneous non-symmetric real special manifold L(16, 1, 0) in the classiﬁcation cited
in [56,57].
Symmetry reduction along the WV of the highest-dimensional central extension
occurring in the r.h.s. of (5), namely, along the9 + 1 dimensional WV of the 9-brane, yields
the breaking
so17,1 → so9,1⊕ so8⊕ (10, 8v); (7)
256 = (16, 8s)⊕
(
16′, 8c
)
; (8)
256′ =
(
16′, 8s
)
⊕ (16, 8c), (9)

--- page 5 ---
Universe 2021, 7, 462 5 of 14
thus yielding an so8 inner/ﬁber symmetry, whose only peculiar polarization is shown in
the branchings (7)–(9).
Let us recall that, in the models for family uniﬁcation beyond the SM, such as the ones
discussed in [58,59], one posits a further breaking of the inner symmetry,
so8 → so5⊕ so3⊕ (5, 3)≃ usp4⊕ su2⊕ (5, 3); (10)
8v = (5, 1)⊕ (1, 3); 8s = (4, 2); 8c =
(
4, 2
)
, (11)
where so3 is used for family symmetry [58].
3.2. Superalgebra in 20 + 4 and 12-Brane WV Reduction
Another example is provided by the quasi-conformal level of the above symmetry,
namely, by the the (1, 0) superalgebra obtained by setting n = 1 in Equation (3.8) of [30],
the chiral superalgebra of ESYM in D = 20 + 4 space–time dimensions, whose central
extensions are given by the r.h.s. of the anticommutator
{
Qα, Qβ
}
= ηαβ Z + (γµ 1...µ 4 )αβ Zµ 1...µ 4 + (γµ 1...µ 8 )αβ Zµ 1...µ 8 + (γµ 1...µ 12 )αβ Zµ 1...µ 12, (12)
namely, by a 0-brane, a 4-brane, an electric 8-brane and its dual, a magnetic 12-brane. The
corresponding 5-graded EP algebra is obtained by setting n = 1 in (II.16) of [55].
e(1)
8(−24) := so20,4⊕ 2048 (13)
= 22−2⊕ 1024′
−1⊕ (so19,3⊕ R)0⊕ 10241,⊕222, (14)
where 2048 and 1024 denote the MW semispinors in 20 + 4 and 19 + 3 dimensions, re-
spectively. Again, when the spinors and vectors are interpreted as Abelian translational
generators, the non-negatively graded part of the EP algebra e(1)
8(−24) (14) corresponds to the
Lie algebra of the global isometry group of the homogeneous non-symmetric quaternionic
Kähler manifold given by the image of the aforementioned space L(16, 1, 0) under the
composite c·R-map [56,57].
The symmetry reduction along the WV of the highest-dimensional central extension
occurring in the r.h.s. of (12), namely the 12 + 4 dimensional WV of the 12-brane, yields
the breaking
so20,4 → so12,4⊕ so8⊕ (16, 8v); (15)
2048 = (128, 8s)⊕
(
128′, 8c
)
, (16)
thus again yielding an so8 inner/ﬁber symmetry, where128 and 128′ stand for the MW
semispinor in 12 + 4 dimensions and its conjugate, respectively.
3.2.1. Further Reduction in Inner/Fiber Symmetry
Through a disentangling mechanism discussed in Section 4, one copy of the 128
encodes SM matter and the rest provides thousands of fermionic degrees of freedom.
A possible way to do this is to further break the inner/ﬁber symmetryso8 down to
so7 and/or g2:
so20,4 → so12,4⊕ so8⊕ (16, 8v)→ so12,4⊕ so7⊕ (1, 7)⊕ (16, 7)⊕ (16, 1); (17)
2048 = (128, 8s)⊕
(
128′, 8c
)
= (128, 8)⊕
(
128′, 8
)
, (18)
or
so20,4 → so12,4⊕ so8⊕ (16, 8v)→ so12,4⊕ so7⊕ (1, 7)⊕ (16, 7)⊕ (16, 1)
→ so12,4⊕ g2⊕ 2· (1, 7)⊕ (16, 7)⊕ (16, 1); (19)
2048 = (128, 8s)⊕
(
128′, 8c
)
= (128, 8)⊕
(
128′, 8
)
= (128, 7)⊕
(
128′, 7
)
⊕ (128, 1)⊕
(
128′, 1
)
. (20)
