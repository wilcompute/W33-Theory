Abstract: Warm dark matter particles with masses in the keV range have been linked with the large
group representations in gauge theories through a high number of species at decoupling. In this
paper, we address WDM fermionic degrees of freedom from such representations. Bridging higher-
dimensional particle physics theories with cosmology studies and astrophysical observations, our
approach is two-folded, i.e., it includes realistic models from higher-dimensional representations and
constraints from simulations tested against observations. Starting with superalgebras in exceptional
periodicity theories, we discuss several symmetry reductions and we consider several representations
that accommodate a high number of degrees of freedom. We isolate a model that naturally accommo-
dates both the standard model representation and the fermionic dark matter in agreement with both
large and small-scale constraints. This model considers an intersection of branes in D = 27 + 3 in a
manner that provides the degrees of freedom for the standard model on one hand and 2048 fermionic
degrees of freedom for dark matter, corresponding to a∼2 keV particle mass, on the other. In this
context, we discuss the theoretical implications and the observable predictions.

1. Introduction
In the past decade, having been thoroughly tested against the data from observations,
the cold dark matter (CDM) model has encountered difﬁculties in explaining these data and
has proved to be inconsistent with the observations under several aspects. Besides the two
initial concerns—the large cores in galaxies and the small number of satellites—that may
or may not be reconciled by introducing ﬁnely tuned baryonic processes in the simulations,
there are several other points of concern at both small and large scales, e.g., the fact that the
population of dwarf galaxies in voids is in contradiction with the predictions from CDM
simulations [1–3]; the failure to replicate, in CDM simulations, the high number of pure
bulgeless galaxies observed and the low number of galaxy mergers [4,5]; the formation and
growth of supermassive black holes in agreement with observed distributions [6]; and the
recent detection of high-redshift quasars [7].
WDM scenarios with particles in the keV range are gaining ground in explaining
some of these discrepancies and many studies show the advantages that a keV dark matter
model presents in explaining the observations at both small and large scales [8–18]. A keV
WDM particle, for example, can explain the existence of cores in galaxies of varied masses,
from dwarf galaxies to spirals, when considering the quantum Fermi pressure of the
particles [12–14]. Moreover, while, for spiral galaxies, in an attempt to reconcile the CDM
model with observations, the presence of the cores has been attributed to the stars and
gas concentration at the center of galaxies—tentatively described by adding baryonic
components in the simulations, with different studies showing different results, sometimes
contradictory (e.g., [19,20])—for dwarf galaxies, which are dark matter dominated, this
cannot be the case.

Furthermore, in WDM models with keV particles, stars can form early on inside the
ﬁlaments, as shown in unparalleled high-resolution simulations [21] and could provide
the seeds for the early formation of black holes, predictions that could be tested with more
such high-resolution simulation studies.
Given the challenges that the CDM is facing and in the absence of a successful experi-
mental detection of a CDM particle candidate, studies of warm dark matter models are
highly justiﬁed both from the theoretical and numerical perspectives.
From the point of view of particle physics, the theoretical models that predict candi-
dates for the generically called ‘warm dark matter’ are more varied than those for CDM,
with different production mechanisms that translate into several intrinsic properties of
the dark matter particles, reviewed in [22]. The consensus to what these particles have in
common is that they possess an astronomically signiﬁcant free streaming length. The free
streaming length implies a cutoff in the power spectrum and a non-zero velocity disper-
sion. The value for these ‘quantities’ is dictated by the particular model and production
mechanism and it gives a certain mass for the considered particle. In [16,17], several WDM
particle models and their assumptions have been re-examined, showing how strongly
model-dependent their properties are and, consequently, how weak the constraints on the
particle mass from the over-simpliﬁed simulations are.
Therefore, the catch comes from the freedom WDM provides in terms of the particle
candidates that are theorized in this category, mainly in the mass-velocity correspondence.
Since, in reality, we can only constrain, with observations and simulations, the velocity
dispersion of the particle and not the mass, other particle physics constraints have to be
considered in the absence of detection experimental results.
A particular model that has been extensively used in warm dark matter simulations
is the one described in [ 23], which implies a much higher number of degrees of free-
dom at decoupling than for the standard model and its supersymmetric extensions [24].
As hinted in [ 23], this would be possible in larger gauge groups, especially those with
extra dimensions.
Several studies have looked at larger gauge group representations in relation to dark
matter [25–29], but none that would explain the high number of degrees of freedom. In the
context of the so-called exceptional super Yang Mills theories, large group representations
that could allow this high number to be reached have been explored [30,31]. In this paper,
we revise these results and attempt to develop and isolate models that would produce the
required high number of degrees of freedom at decoupling, while preserving the standard
model representations. We found that these representations favor 2048 fermionic degrees
of freedom at decoupling, which corresponds to a∼2 keV particle, which happens to be in
agreement with observations.
In Section 2, we review the warm dark matter model requirement of such high degrees
of freedom. In Section 3, we introduce the algebras with higher dimensional spinors
and discuss several reductions in the context of exceptional periodicity. In Section 4, we
discuss the WDM and SM disentanglement through braneworld intersections, isolating a
mechanism through which SM degrees of freedom are isolated from WDM ones and WDM
becomes neutral under the photon gauging the electromagnetic U(1). Our conclusions are
summarized in Section 5.
2. keV WDM from Higher-Dimensional Gauge Theories
Within the WDM scenario, several models with various particle production mecha-
nisms and various properties have been previously studied. We can distinguish between
thermally produced neutrinos and those coming from a non-resonant production mecha-
nism [32–36] for particles in the eV–hundreds keV range that do not decay. More complex
models that consider decay [37] and re-thermalization [38] have also been considered as
well as quantum semi-degenerate particles with a non-negligible chemical potential [16].
However, in numerical simulations, the varied models are oversimpliﬁed, often using
a ‘cutoff’ in the power spectrum as the only parameter that distinguishes WDM from CDM

particles, as reviewed in [39]. The model most favored by simulation studies for a thermal
relic WDM particle, which provides this ‘cutoff’ mass-velocity, is the one described in [23].
Below, we discuss this model, its assumptions and its implications.
WDM Degrees of Freedom
The particle assumed in [ 23] is a thermal relic particle that decouples while still
relativistic, but, by equality, is nonrelativistic. The streaming speed at equality vs/c ∝
TX/mX, where the effective temperature TX varies inversely with the scale factor. In
order to have a streaming speed that is low enough to keep up with the CDM success
at large scales—meaning, the formation of structures as an early enough redshift and
within the observable mass scales for halos—the decrease in the effective temperature is
suggested [23]. If the particle decouples with thermal abundance, ρX ∝ T3
XmX must be
held ﬁxed. Therefore, to obtain a reasonable reduction in velocity, one needs to decrease
the temperature and increase the mass. One way the reduction in temperature can be
realized is through increasing the number of the degrees of freedom at decoupling. The
example given in [23] assumes a reduction in TX of∼4 and an increase in mass of 43, thus
corresponding to 688 degrees of freedom. However, for 1 keV , the number of degrees
of freedom is higher and this is usually what is indirectly used in simulations when the
velocity of the WDM particle is introduced, as shown in [16,17].
Below, we remind the derivation in [23] and the discussion in [16]. As recalled in [23]
(see [23] Appendix A for a detailed derivation and [16] for a detailed assessment of that
derivation), for a thermal relict particle X that decouples when relativistic, the abundance
nX relative to photons is
nX

gdec
)( 4

)gX
2 , (1)
where gdec is the number of relativistic species present at decoupling—degrees of freedom—
and gX is the number of spin states of the particle. Assuming that the distribution function
scales as the non-thermal distribution (exp(v/v0) + 1)−1, for a redshift z, the velocity v0
(in Equation (A3) [23]) is given,
v0(z)

Therefore, for an mX = 1 keV particle, considering ΩX = 0.3 as in [23], we have the
following formula for the velocity:
v0(z)
1 + z≈ 0.12
( 1

that gives gdec≈ 1000 (gX/1.5)1/3 for a 1 keV particle.
This large value for the number of degrees of freedom at decoupling is much higher
than the value for the standard model, ∼107, and even the supersymmetric extension,
∼229 [24]. Other studies arbitrarily choose, in their analyses, a much more conservative
value for the number of degrees of freedom of the WDM particle candidates, i.e., ∼150
for a massive neutrino [24];∼100 for right-handed neutrinos that would decouple before
the electro-weak phase transition [ 40]. The number of degrees of freedom scales with
the mass of the particle therefore a higher mass would correspond to a higher number of
degrees of freedom (and a stronger decrease in temperature). Since this value is correlated
to the mass–velocity correspondence that dictates the behavior of the WDM particle and its

inﬂuence on the structure formation and evolution, we study the theoretical models where
such a large number of degrees of freedom can be achieved.
While the authors in [23] do hint at larger group representations with extra dimensions
in relation to the high gdec number, they also mention that entropy-producing processes
that take place after the decoupling of the particle can mimic an increase in gdec. Indeed,
trying to avoid such large group representations, [22,41–43] discuss the entropy generation
by the out-of-equilibrium decay of heavier particles, which would allow the number of
degrees of freedom of the keV particle to be similar to that used for active neutrinos [41].
Self-interactions as a possible way to reduce the number densities by self-annihilations
are also discussed in [ 44]. However, in this paper, we look at the large gauge group
representations that would naturally produce this high number of degrees of freedom,
starting with the symmetry reductions in algebras with higher-dimensional spinors in
exceptional periodicity theories.
3. Algebras with Higher-Dimensional Spinors
A class of algebras involving higher-dimensional spinors is studied in the so-called
exceptional super Yang–Mills (ESYM) theories, ﬁrstly discussed in [30,31], in which higher-
dimensional theories [45–50] beyond string/M-theory [51,52] have been considered and
extended, also in relation to exceptional periodicity (EP) algebras [53–55]. In this section, we
provide various branchings of these algebras with a number of spinor degrees of freedom
ofO(103). Here, we discuss the symmetry reductions along the worldvolume (WV) of
p-branes, which centrally extend the underlying chiral superalgebra and the reductions
that follow the so-called Magic Star structure—named so in [ 53] after the star polygon
geometric shape—of the corresponding EP algebra.
3.1. Superalgebra in 17 + 1 and 9-Brane WV Reduction
One of the simplest examples is based on the (1, 0) superalgebra obtained by setting
n = 1 in Equation (3.5) of [30], namely, the chiral superalgebra of ESYM in D = s + t =
17 + 1 space–time dimensions, whose central extensions are given by the r.h.s. of the
anticommutator
{
Qα, Qβ
}
= (γµ )αβ Pµ + (γµ 1...µ 5 )αβ Zµ 1...µ 5 + (γµ 1...µ 9 )αβ Zµ 1...µ 9, (5)
namely, by a 1-brane (fundamental string), an electric 5-brane and its dual, a magnetic
9-brane. The corresponding EP 3-graded algebra, whose semisimple, 0-graded part yields
the homogeneous Lorentz algebra of 17 + 1 space–time, is obtained by setting n = 1 in
(II.14) of [55], namely,
e(1)
6(−26) := 256′
−1⊕ (so17,1⊕ R)0⊕ 2561, (6)
where 256 and 256′, respectively, denote the Majorana–Weyl (MW) semispinor in17 + 1
dimensions and its conjugate (note that the EP leveln is understood with +1 in [30], namely,
the ﬁrst non-trivial level of EP is given by n = 2 therein). It should be remarked that, when
the spinors are interpreted as Abelian translational generators, the non-negatively graded
part of the EP algebra e(1)
6(−26) (6) yields the Lie algebra of the global isometry group of the
homogeneous non-symmetric real special manifold L(16, 1, 0) in the classiﬁcation cited
in [56,57].
Symmetry reduction along the WV of the highest-dimensional central extension
occurring in the r.h.s. of (5), namely, along the9 + 1 dimensional WV of the 9-brane, yields
the breaking
so17,1 → so9,1⊕ so8⊕ (10, 8v); (7)
256 = (16, 8s)⊕
(
16′, 8c
)
; (8)
256′ =
(
16′, 8s
)
⊕ (16, 8c), (9)

--- page 5 ---
Universe 2021, 7, 462 5 of 14
thus yielding an so8 inner/ﬁber symmetry, whose only peculiar polarization is shown in
the branchings (7)–(9).
Let us recall that, in the models for family uniﬁcation beyond the SM, such as the ones
discussed in [58,59], one posits a further breaking of the inner symmetry,
so8 → so5⊕ so3⊕ (5, 3)≃ usp4⊕ su2⊕ (5, 3); (10)
8v = (5, 1)⊕ (1, 3); 8s = (4, 2); 8c =
(
4, 2
)
, (11)
where so3 is used for family symmetry [58].
3.2. Superalgebra in 20 + 4 and 12-Brane WV Reduction
Another example is provided by the quasi-conformal level of the above symmetry,
namely, by the the (1, 0) superalgebra obtained by setting n = 1 in Equation (3.8) of [30],
the chiral superalgebra of ESYM in D = 20 + 4 space–time dimensions, whose central
extensions are given by the r.h.s. of the anticommutator
{
Qα, Qβ
}
= ηαβ Z + (γµ 1...µ 4 )αβ Zµ 1...µ 4 + (γµ 1...µ 8 )αβ Zµ 1...µ 8 + (γµ 1...µ 12 )αβ Zµ 1...µ 12, (12)
namely, by a 0-brane, a 4-brane, an electric 8-brane and its dual, a magnetic 12-brane. The
corresponding 5-graded EP algebra is obtained by setting n = 1 in (II.16) of [55].
e(1)
8(−24) := so20,4⊕ 2048 (13)
= 22−2⊕ 1024′
−1⊕ (so19,3⊕ R)0⊕ 10241,⊕222, (14)
where 2048 and 1024 denote the MW semispinors in 20 + 4 and 19 + 3 dimensions, re-
spectively. Again, when the spinors and vectors are interpreted as Abelian translational
generators, the non-negatively graded part of the EP algebra e(1)
8(−24) (14) corresponds to the
Lie algebra of the global isometry group of the homogeneous non-symmetric quaternionic
Kähler manifold given by the image of the aforementioned space L(16, 1, 0) under the
composite c·R-map [56,57].
The symmetry reduction along the WV of the highest-dimensional central extension
occurring in the r.h.s. of (12), namely the 12 + 4 dimensional WV of the 12-brane, yields
the breaking
so20,4 → so12,4⊕ so8⊕ (16, 8v); (15)
2048 = (128, 8s)⊕
(
128′, 8c
)
, (16)
thus again yielding an so8 inner/ﬁber symmetry, where128 and 128′ stand for the MW
semispinor in 12 + 4 dimensions and its conjugate, respectively.
3.2.1. Further Reduction in Inner/Fiber Symmetry
Through a disentangling mechanism discussed in Section 4, one copy of the 128
encodes SM matter and the rest provides thousands of fermionic degrees of freedom.
A possible way to do this is to further break the inner/ﬁber symmetryso8 down to
so7 and/or g2:
so20,4 → so12,4⊕ so8⊕ (16, 8v)→ so12,4⊕ so7⊕ (1, 7)⊕ (16, 7)⊕ (16, 1); (17)
2048 = (128, 8s)⊕
(
128′, 8c
)
= (128, 8)⊕
(
128′, 8
)
, (18)
or
so20,4 → so12,4⊕ so8⊕ (16, 8v)→ so12,4⊕ so7⊕ (1, 7)⊕ (16, 7)⊕ (16, 1)
→ so12,4⊕ g2⊕ 2· (1, 7)⊕ (16, 7)⊕ (16, 1); (19)
2048 = (128, 8s)⊕
(
128′, 8c
)
= (128, 8)⊕
(
128′, 8
)
= (128, 7)⊕
(
128′, 7
)
⊕ (128, 1)⊕
(
128′, 1
)
. (20)

--- page 6 ---
Universe 2021, 7, 462 6 of 14
While this isolates a 128 as a singlet of g2 and has additional fermions, breaking so12,4
further to identify the standard model and electromagnetism would lead to the additional
fermions to have the same charge, therefore not be dark matter. Nevertheless, the utilization
of the 2048 spinor in e(1)
8(−24) is later used to identify a candidate for WDM.
3.2.2. Magic Star Reduction in D = 20 + 4
Another possible symmetry reduction on the same ESYM, which is useful in order to
discuss family uniﬁcation beyond the SM, concerns the exploitation of the so-called Magic
Star [53] decomposition of the EP algebra e(1)
8(−24) (13)–(14), with the EP algebra e(1)
6(−26) (6)
posited in the center of the star-like arrangement of (generalized) roots,
e(1)
8(−24) = e(1)
6(−26)⊕ sl3(R)⊕

as depicted in Figure 1, where T8,1
3 denotes the Hermitian part of the special Vinberg
cubic T-algebra [60,61] with elements realized as formal 3× 3 Hermitian matrices, whose
manifestly so16-covariant structure reads

where 128 and 128′, respectively, denote the MW semispinor in 16 dimensions and its
conjugate (the case q = 8 and n = 1 of Equation (III.1) of [ 55]). In addition, it is here
worth recalling that the Hermitian matrix-like structure (22) corresponds to the manifestly
so17,1-covariant Peirce decomposition
T8,1
3 = 1−4⊕ 182⊕ 256−1, (23)
where the so17,1-singlet corresponds to the so16-singlet 1I I I in (22).

4. Symmetry Reduction to the Standard Model and Warm Dark Matter Disentanglement
By studying E8× E8 heterotic string theory on the boundary of an 11-dimensional
supergravity bulk, two E8 gauge theories on the endpoints of an orbifold fromR10× S1/Z2
have been found [62,63]. The anomaly cancellation requires a twelve-form, which is factor-
ized into a 4-form and 8-form, yet these are invoked in 10- and 11-dimensional theories,
implying a complete description from larger dimensions. Heterotic string theory must have
an origin from D = 25 + 1 or higher. While bosonic string theory exists in D = 25 + 1, het-
erotic string theory places 16 dimensions on an even, self-dual lattice and includes fermions.
D = 26 + 1 bosonic M-theory and D = 26 + 2 target space–time for 2D gravity has been
introduced [64,65]. How D = 11 + 3 uniﬁes the superalgebras of type I, type IIA, type IIB
and heterotic theories has been articulated in [46–48]. The superalgebras of M-theory and
F-theory can arise from nested braneworlds in D = 27 + 3, as the exceptional Yang–Mills
superalgebra contains an 11-brane worldvolume with spinors [31]. Dimensional reduction
also ﬁnds a 10-brane worldvolume with a 16D transverse space and includes spinors.
The Horava–Witten theory [62,63] shows how M-theory on R9× S1× S1/Z2, when
compactiﬁed on S1, leads to type IIA and E8× E8 heterotic string theories, which are
T-dual to type I and Spin (16)× Spin (16)⊂ Spin (32) superstring theories. This implies
that the type I superstring on R9× S1 naturally has a Spin (16)× Spin (16) vacuum. Dark
matter has been discussed in relation to nonsupersymmetricSpin (16)× Spin (16) string the-
ory [25,26,29]. While heterotic string theory leading to the supersymmetric standard model
allows for supersymmetric light dark matter candidates such as neutralinos [ 66], light
supersymmetric partners of the standard model below 1.5 TeV have not been observed [67].
The exceptional Yang–Mills superalgebras facilitate an understanding of various world-
volume constructions for M-theory and beyond, which allows for supersymmetric forms
of matter beyond the standard model that are different from the superpartners or the
nonsupersymmetric dark matter models..
Since the membranes discussed in this section are more complicated than those
contained within M-theory itself, a brief pedagogical introduction to membranes and
their relationship to gauge theory is warranted. To start, let us consider the worldline
formulation of a free point particle described by the following action:
S0 =−mc
∫
ds =−mc
∫ √
gµν ˙xµ ˙xνdτ. (24)
Varying this action leads to the standard geodesic equation in general relativity. Extended
objects in supergravity lead to “p-brane” for arbitrary-dimensional membranes, which
spans a (p + 1)-dimensional worldvolume and generalizes the worldline formulation
above [68]. While strings are 1-branes on a worldsheet and M-theory has a 2-brane world-
volume, 3-brane worldvolumes were found in type IIB supergravity [69]. F-theory admits
3-brane phenomenology that can include the standard model with gravity [70]. Further-
more, 3-branes are intimately related to AdS5, whose isometry group is the conformal
group Spin (4, 2). Additionally, AdS5 supports a 4D CFT with a 3-brane on the boundary,
such that dS4 can be obtained within the Randall–Sundrum model [71,72].
Before the full signiﬁcance of the Yang–Mills theory for the standard model was estab-
lished, the nonlinear sigma model was introduced for pions, which is a nonrenormalizable
theory similar to general relativity. General relativity is equivalent to a nonlinear sigma
model Lagrangian [73], which is similarly used for the bosonic sector of p-branes:

]
, (25)
where CM1... Mp+1 is a p + 1-form potential sourced by the p-brane and X M is a scalar ﬁeld
with an index with respect to the target space, such as D = 10 + 1 in M-theory. The bosonic
p-brane Lagrangian in the static gauge leads to a Born–Infeld action,

, (26)
where T = 1/(2πlP)p is the brane tension. The Born–Infeld action was introduced as
an electrodynamical theory; it is the 1-loop renormalization of QED. The historical de-
velopments of transitioning from the non-renormalizable nonlinear sigma model to the
renormalizable Yang–Mills theory suggest that the Yang–Mills gauge gravity theories,
such as the MacDowell–Mansouri theory, will remain important for the uniﬁcation of the
standard model and gravity [74]. As braneworlds are intimately related to the study of
gravity and beyond-the-standard-model physics is necessary for dark matter, we propose
that braneworld spinors allow us to consider new dark matter candidates.
We brieﬂy review the representation theory of the standard model as well as the most
common high-energy GUT models, recalling that SU(3)c× U(1)e⊂ SU(5)⊂ Spin (10)⊂
E6(−78)⊂ E8(−24). E6(−78) allows us to consider three charts of Spin (10)× U(1), such
that E8(−24) contains three charts of Spin (10)× Spin (2, 4) for a combination of GUT and
conformal symmetries. The D = 12 + 4 (1,0) chiral super-Poincaré algebra also exists and
contains a 128 spinor. When breaking to Spin (2, 4)× Spin (10), the three conformal charts
span Spin (4, 4) (associated to a conformal braneworld symmetry), such that three distinct
16 representations of Spin (10) are found, each leading to the standard model fermion
representations with respect to SU(3)c× SU(2)L× U(1)Y,

At high energies, an SU(2, 2)× U(1) conformal gauge group, axial U(1) and SU(5)
GUT leads to SU(7, 2), which is also a maximal subalgebra of E8(−24). An E8(−24) gauge
theory does not need to be considered, but rather gauge theories from subalgebras. For
instance, E6 GUT contains a complex 27 and 27 in combination with the adjoint representa-
tion 78 [75].
Combined with another U(1), the total of all of these states leads to E7 by combining
the adjoint bosonic sector with the complex fermionic sector.
133 = 27⊕ 78⊕ 1⊕ 27. (29)
As shown above, the representations found within E6 GUT stem from a single adjoint
representation of E7; similarly,E8. Recently, using E6 to obtain the standard model spectrum
has been explored [76] without using E6 GUT. E8 for three generations of matter has also
been explored [77], although conformal spacetime symmetry was not considered. This non-
supersymmetric E8 GUT model and the supersymmetric E8× E8 heterotic string theory
use this to make contact with three generations of matter. Since two of the authors recently
found EP algebras that generalize E8 [53], we expand the exploration of the representations
associated with these algebras. Dark matter is an immediate natural candidate, as the
EP algebras contain spinors for matter beyond the standard model. Superalgebras are
explored to motivate braneworld intersections that naturally lead to the standard model
spectrum as described above, along with additional dark matter candidates.
4.1. Braneworld Spinors
D = 26 + 1 M-theory with a 8, 192 spinor [ 78] and many p-branes provides an
origin for heterotic string theory and M-theory. A 2-brane, 5-brane, 10-brane, 13-brane,
18-brane and 21-brane is found from considering a superalgebra with 8, 192 supercharges.

Universe 2021, 7, 462 9 of 14
D = 10 + 1 M-theory has a 2-brane and 5-brane, while a 21-brane was anticipated in
D = 26 + 1 bosonic M-theory [64]. In D = 26 + 1, a 10-brane and 18-brane allow for a (10,1)
worldvolume theory and a (18,1) worldvolume theory. Breaking Spin (26, 1) to various
subgroups makes contact with worldvolume and transverse symmetries of interest.
Braneworld Worldvolume Transverse Spinors
2-brane Spin (2, 1) Spin (24) (2, 2048′)⊕ (2, 2048)
10-brane Spin (10, 1) Spin (16) (32, 128′)⊕ (32′, 128)
18-brane Spin (18, 1) Spin (8) (512, 8′)⊕ (512′, 8)
(30)
in which the breaking of the 8, 192 spinor is also provided. The 2-brane relates to the
Horowitz–Susskind [64] D = 2 + 1 CFT with SO(24) global symmetry and AdS4× S23
holography. The spinors in the 10-brane worldvolume only see the 32 spinor of M-theory
from (32, 128) components. The D = 26 + 1 theory contains a 128 spinor of a transverse
Spin (16), just as the superstring has an 8s spinor of Spin (8). This can be compared to the
Horava–Witten theory [62,63] with R10× S1/Z2, by orbifolding a spatial direction of the
10-brane. The 18-brane gives a D = 18 + 1 “M-theory" that reduces to a D = 17 + 1 string
theory as studied in relation to Kac–Moody algebras [79]. Quasiconformal extensions of
the 2-brane, 10-brane, 18-brane and global space–time motivate Spin (4, 4), Spin (12, 4),
Spin (20, 4) and Spin (28, 4) symmetries and their EP extensions.
Spin (12, 4) is the conformal symmetry of Spin (11, 3), whose exceptional Yang–Mills
superalgebra admits a Hodge duality between a 3-brane and 7-brane when the 3-brane
is treated as a worldvolume for space–time, generalizing the 2-brane and 5-brane. The
isometry group of the 3-brane (3,3) worldvolume has Spin (4, 4) conformal symmetry,
which describes three generations of matter [80,81]. A transverse Spin (8) is used for visible
matter within Spin (12, 4), where fermionic degrees of freedom can be encoded by a 128
spinor of Spin (12, 4), leading to e8(−24). Going to Spin (20, 4) or Spin (28, 4) allows us to
consider transverse Spin (16) or Spin (24) for possible dark matter.
D = 28 + 4 entails the following braneworld twistors for three generations:
Braneworld Conformal worldvolume Transverse Spinors
3-brane Spin (4, 4) Spin (24) (8, 2048′)⊕ (8′, 2048)
11-brane Spin (12, 4) Spin (16) (128, 128′)⊕ (128′, 128)
19-brane Spin (20, 4) Spin (8) (2048, 8′)⊕ (2048′, 8)
(31)
Taking the 11-brane and 19-brane in D = 27 + 3, they are forced to intersect spatially via a
3-brane. The 11-brane isolates a D = 11 + 3 worldvolume with a 3-brane and dual 7-brane,
while the 19-brane isolates a D = 19 + 3 worldvolume with a 3-brane and dual 15-brane.
Our proposal is that the D = 11 + 3 worldvolume theory encodes baryonic matter, while
the D = 19 + 3 theory encodes a dark matter sector.
EP algebras provide new dark matter models via intersected or nested higher mem-
brane worldvolumes. In order to combine dark matter and the standard model within the
same space–time worldvolume, e(2)
8(−24) with so28,4 is of interest, as it contains so12,4⊕ so16
in addition to various vector and spinor representations. The group Spin (12, 4) combines
the 4D conformal group with Spin (10) GUT. The compact real form of e(2)
8 also contains
so16⊕ so16, which has been studied in relation to dark matter in a different context [29].
4.2. Braneworld Intersections for Warm Dark Matter beyond the Standard Model
One candidate for describing the standard model from string theory is the utilization
of D3 and D7 branes from type IIB supergravity or F-theory [ 82]. The central extension
of D = 11 + 3 minimal chiral (1, 0) superalgebra naturally contains a 3-brane and dual
7-brane, as well as the type IIB superalgebra [47,48]. The role of E8(−24) with Spin (12, 4)
in the context of background-independent two-time M-theory and heterotic string theory
withN = 2 or 1 has been mentioned in [83]. A single generation of fermions can be found
via 64 of Spin (11, 3) as off-shell degrees of freedom [84]. While breaking Spin (12, 4)→

--- page 10 ---
Universe 2021, 7, 462 10 of 14
Spin (2, 4)× Spin (10) is tempting, this makes it difﬁcult to identify the three generations
of matter with less than 2048 spinors without another consideration. Some of the authors
have explored how SU(3, 2)× SU(5) (maximal and non-symmetric subgroup of E8(−24))
naturally leads to three conformal charts, in a manner similar to how quasiconformal
groups with four times are the conformal group for three generations of matter [81]. The
corresponding (1,0) chiral super-Poincaré algebra in D = 12 + 4 entails three generations
of the standard model within 128 of Spin (12, 4) instead of 192 off-shell degrees of freedom.
Throughout this section, it is assumed that three generations of the standard model
stem from a 3-brane and dual 7-brane, immersed in an 11-brane worldvolume. To go be-
yond the standard model and include dark matter candidates, a 15-brane is also considered.
The 3-brane and 15-brane exist inside a 19-brane worldvolume. The possible p-branes in
D = 27 + 3 are shown in Figure 2. In particular, visible matter and dark matter are iso-
lated on the 11-brane and 19-brane, such that they intersect on the 11 + 19− 27 = 3-brane
worldvolume for space–time. In this manner, the braneworld intersection identiﬁes visi-
ble and dark matter with different forces, yet they exist within the same space–time. The
D = 27 + 3 theory may be isolated to D = 19 + 3 for dark matter, yet reduced toD = 11 + 3
for visible matter.
Here, a model via Spin (12, 4)× Spin (16) is pursued. The Spin (16) factor arises from
the transverse symmetry of an 11-brane worldvolume in D = 27 + 3. Then, we study a
braneworld intersection of the 11-brane and 19-brane in D = 27 + 3.
By restricting to the 11-brane worldvolume, the 3-brane is dual to a 7-brane. Isolating the
conformal group of the 11-brane worldvolume withine(2)
8(−24) encodes a transverseSpin (16),

Figure 2. The intersections of branes in D = 27 + 3. For instance, the 3-brane is dual to the 23-brane,
which contains the 7-brane and 15-brane.
Once the 3-brane worldvolume is isolated within the 11-brane worldvolume, Spin (8)
is found as being transverse to Spin (4, 4) as the conformal worldvolume symmetry. The
3-brane within the 11-brane within D = 27 + 3 has the effect of making the Spin (16)
transverse to the 11-brane hidden with respect to the matter isolated to the 3-brane and
dual 7-brane within D = 11 + 3.

Universe 2021, 7, 462 11 of 14
On the other hand, by restricting to the 19-brane worldvolume, the 3-brane is dual
to a 15-brane. Isolating the conformal group of the 19-brane worldvolume within e(2)
8(−24)
leads to a transverse Spin (8).

= ( 8s, 128′, 8c)⊕ (8c, 128, 8c)⊕ (8c, 128, 8s)⊕ (8s, 128′, 8s). (37)
Once the 3-brane worldvolume is isolated within the 19-brane worldvolume, Spin (16)
is transverse to Spin (4, 4). The 3-brane within the 19-brane in a bulk D = 27 + 3 leaves the
Spin (8) transverse to the 19-brane hidden with respect to matter isolated to the 3-brane
and its dual 15-brane within D = 19 + 3.
While isolating the 3-brane in the 19-brane versus 11-brane symmetries within e(2)
8(−24)
leads to different representations, not all representations of the fermions are identiﬁable.
For instance, the 11-brane cannot access a 15-brane in its transverse space, such that the
so16 representations are unobservable, while the 19-brane cannot access a 7-brane in its
transverse space, such that the so8 representations are unobservable. We assume that the
so8 transverse to the 19-brane contains the electromagnetic u1 of the standard model [85].
With the 11-brane and 19-brane intersection, the 3-brane effectively sees the following
fermionic representations with respect to Spin (4, 4)× Spin (8)× Spin (16):
(8s, 8c, 1)⊕ (8c, 8s, 1)⊕ (8s, 1, 128′)⊕ (8c, 1, 128), (38)
where the singlets effectively arise at low energies, since a 3-brane in an 11-brane cannot
probe a transverse 15-brane immersed in D = 27 + 3, for instance. As such, since the
3-brane is the intersection of two worldvolumes, 128 visible and 2048 dark fermions are
found effectively at low energy from an intersecting braneworld model that contains
worldvolumes that support the commonly studied supergravities and string theories. The
2048 dark fermions come from (8s, 1, 128′)⊕ (8c, 1, 128), which cannot be probed by the
so8 containing the electromagnetic u1.
This number of degrees of freedom corresponds to

keV≈ 17.8ΩXh2 1.5

, (39)
a∼2 keV particle that is in agreement with observations at both large scales—galaxy
formation and distribution—and small scales—cores [12,13].
5. Conclusions
In this paper, we discuss possible large gauge group representations that allow us to
obtain a high number of fermionic degrees of freedom using superalgebras in the context
of exceptional periodicity models and M-theory braneworlds. We ﬁnd that an 11-brane
and 19-brane in D = 27 + 3 intersect by a 3-brane for space–time such that respective dual
7-branes and 15-branes provide both the degrees of freedom for the standard model and
the ones for fermionic WDM, while preserving the ‘separation’ and the lack of interaction
between SM and WDM particles. Since so12,4 combines conformal symmetry with so10,
the so8 contains su3⊕ u1 of the strong and electromagnetic forces, such that the 19-brane
does not interact with light; therefore, it is dark.
In this realization, the intersecting braneworlds span D = 27 + 3, but individually
span D = 11 + 3 and D = 19 + 3. For D = 11 + 3, the 3-brane is dual to a 7-brane for light
matter in 128 off-shell degrees of freedom. For D = 19 + 3, the 3-brane is dual to a 15-brane
for dark matter. We ﬁnd 2048 fermionic degrees of freedom in this representation, which

--- page 12 ---
Universe 2021, 7, 462 12 of 14
correspond to∼2 keV in the model cited in [23]. This particle spectrum is in agreement with
constraints from structure formation. Moreover, a 2 keV particle inﬂuences the formation of
cores in galaxies [12,13]. Several other representations have been discussed and analyzed.
However, this representation has the advantage of naturally allowing for a WDM candidate
that is interesting from the point of view of astrophysical constraints and also implying
worldvolumes that support supergravities and string theories. The evolution of a particle
produced in this manner can be discussed further. While beyond the scope of this paper,
further investigations of what happens to these species once the particle decouples would
provide additional constraints.
