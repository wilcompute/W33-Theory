Quick Terminal Guidance

- Kill extra terminals: Terminal → Kill All Terminals (or click the trash icon on each terminal).
- Open one activated terminal: Terminal → Run Task → **Open Activated PowerShell**. This will run `.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1` and show `Virtual environment activated.`

To stop an AI extension from auto-opening a terminal:
- Open Extensions view → find the extension (e.g., Claude Code Chat, GitHub Copilot Chat).
- Click the gear → Extension Settings and look for options like “open on start / open panel / run in terminal” and disable them.

If you want, I can attempt to set a specific extension setting for you — tell me which AI extension you want suppressed (e.g., `claudeCodeChat`, `github.copilot`) and I’ll add a workspace preference if it’s available.
