{
  "finding": "For all 5 nontrivial 2T cycles (under the v3 witness), the Clifford word in port generators reduces to the pseudoscalar e0*e1*e2 (mask=7), up to sign.",
  "interpretation": "In Cl(3), the pseudoscalar behaves like the imaginary unit i (central, squares to -1). Thus the transport loops naturally generate a complex structure from purely discrete port moves.",
  "note_on_commutator": "The previously-computed Bargmann commutator phase for each elementary triad move is -1, consistent with anticommutation of distinct Clifford generators."
