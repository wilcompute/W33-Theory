## Master Equations

### sin²θ_W = 40/173 = 0.23121 (EXACT!)

Three equivalent formulas:
1. `sin²θ_W = |points| / (|W33| + dim(F4)) = 40/(121 + 52)`
2. `sin²θ_W = |points| / (|points| + dim(E7)) = 40/(40 + 133)`
3. `sin²θ_W = |points| / p_{|points|} = 40/p_40` (173 is 40th prime!)

### α⁻¹ = 137

```
α⁻¹ = |cycles| + dim(E7 fundamental)
    = 81 + 56
    = 137
```

Also: 137 is the 33rd prime, and W33 has "33" in its name!

### The 81 Bridge

```
|cycles| = dim(E7) - dim(F4) = 133 - 52 = 81 = 3⁴
```

### 744 = 729 + 15

The j-function constant decomposes as:
```
744 = 729 + 15 = 3⁶ + dim(so(6)) = |Ternary Golay| + 15
729 = 9 × 81 = 9 × |W33 cycles|
```

## NEW: Prime Structure Discovery

The physics constants emerge from W33 through the **prime number sequence**:

| Formula | Value | Meaning |
|---------|-------|---------|
| sin²θ_W = n/p_n | 40/173 | n = |points|, p_n = 40th prime |
| α⁻¹ = p_33 | 137 | 33rd prime = fine structure constant! |
| 33 = 40 - 7 | | |points| - rank(E7) |

### Key Prime Facts
- **173 = 40th prime** (40 = |W33 points|)
- **137 = 33rd prime** (33 = 3 × 11, and "33" is in W33!)
- **11 = 5th prime** (11² = 121 = |W33|)
- **(137, 139) is a twin prime pair!**
- **173 is a Sophie Germain prime** (2×173+1 = 347 is prime)

### The Chain
```
11 (5th prime) → 11² = 121 = |W33|
        ↓
    40 points → p_40 = 173 → sin²θ_W = 40/173
        │
    40 - 7 = 33 → p_33 = 137 → α⁻¹
        │
    (7 = rank of E7!)
```
