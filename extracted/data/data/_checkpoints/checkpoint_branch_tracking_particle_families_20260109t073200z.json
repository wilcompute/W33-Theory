    "Localized branches are those that exceed defect node mass 0.6 at some mu. The earliest and strongest localization occurs in m=3, consistent with m=3 being the center/spin-sensitive character sector.",

    "O6_minus_O12 shows polarity: a strongly localized branch in m=3 can persist across negative mu, consistent with a charge-like sign structure between families."
