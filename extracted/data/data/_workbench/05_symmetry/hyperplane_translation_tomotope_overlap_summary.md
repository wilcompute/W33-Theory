# Translation overlap with tomotope15

Counts of tomotope15 lines mapping back into tomotope15 under translations:
- 6: 12 translations
- 9: 12 translations
- 15: 3 translations

max_overlap=15 (translations=3)
- t=(0, 0, 0, 0)
- t=(0, 1, 1, 2)
- t=(0, 2, 2, 1)

Note: the nontrivial max-overlap translations are exactly the D6 order‑3 elements (auto_id=1,2).
