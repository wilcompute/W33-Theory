# Pancharatnam Z3 Phase Protocol (Witting Rays)

This protocol measures the geometric phase for a 3‑ray loop:

Φ = arg(⟨a|b⟩⟨b|c⟩⟨c|a⟩)

The Witting set exhibits phase quantization at 0 and ±2π/3.

## Notes
- Use any standard Pancharatnam/Berry phase interferometer.
- Phase quantization at ±2π/3 is the Z3 signature.
- This is state‑preparation independent (depends only on ray overlaps).
