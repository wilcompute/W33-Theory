# Pancharatnam Z3 Phase Run‑Sheet

This run‑sheet gives concrete ray triples and state‑prep tables.

## Measurement loop
1. Prepare |a⟩
2. Measure phase of ⟨a|b⟩
3. Prepare |b⟩ and measure phase of ⟨b|c⟩
4. Prepare |c⟩ and measure phase of ⟨c|a⟩
5. Sum phases → Φ

## Notes
- Phases are modulo 2π.
- Use common phase reference across interferometric measurements.
