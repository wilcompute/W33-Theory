# Witting 24‑Basis KS Inequality

We define the KS functional as the number of bases satisfied by a
noncontextual 0/1 assignment (exactly one 1 per basis).

## Noncontextual bound (exact)
- Max satisfiable bases: **23 / 24**

## Quantum prediction (state‑independent)
- Quantum value: **24 / 24**

**Reason:** For any quantum state, each orthonormal basis sums to identity,
so the expected ‘one‑outcome’ per basis is exactly 1.

## Inequality
For any noncontextual model:  S ≤ 23.
Quantum mechanics gives:       S = 24.

This yields a state‑independent violation by 1 basis.
