# W33 Theory: Finite-Geometric Kernel for Unification

## Executive Summary

The W33 framework posits a finite-geometric structure as the discrete kernel underlying exceptional Lie algebras, quantum error correction, and potentially physical unification. Starting from three axioms (a 4-dimensional vector space V = F₃⁴, a symplectic form ω, and the induced isotropy relation), the entire tower of structures is forced: codes, modules, cohomology, and E₈-type root systems.

The central mathematical fact is **self-referential closure**: the quotient Q of the 120-root shell equals W33 itself.

## The Bootstrap Property

The quotient Q of the 120-root shell, after global gauge-fixing and collapsing flat triples, is isomorphic to W33 itself. The structure contains itself. This is not assumed but forced by the axioms.
