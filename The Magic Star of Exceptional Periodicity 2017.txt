ABSTRACT
We present a periodic inﬁnite chain of ﬁnite generalisations of the exceptional structures, in-
cluding e8, the exceptional Jordan algebra (and pair), and the octonions. We demonstrate that
the exceptional Jordan algebra is part of an inﬁnite family of ﬁnite-dimensional matrix algebras
(corresponding to a particular class of cubic Vinberg’s T-algebras). Correspondingly, we prove
that e8 is part of an inﬁnite family of algebras (dubbed “Magic Star” algebras) that resemble
lattice vertex algebras.

1 Introduction
In the mind of every mathematician, there is a tension between the general rule and exceptional
cases. Our conscience tells us we should strive for general theorems, yet we are fascinated and
seduced by beautiful exceptions.
J. Stillwell [1]
Since the inception of quantum mechanics operator algebras and their symmetries have
proved to be of central importance. Jordan, Wigner and von Neumann [2], in a rigorous
exploration of extended forms of quantum mechanics, classiﬁed ﬁnite dimensional self-adjoint
operator algebras, now known as formally real Jordan algebras. The exceptional case they found
contained the largest division algebra, the octonions O [3], ﬁrst discovered by J. T. Graves in
1843.
With Gell-Mann’s Eightfold way [4], and subsequent study of the su3 quark and gluon
structures [5, 6], Lie algebras solidiﬁed a ﬁrm role in the study of elementary particles. After
the classiﬁcations by Killing and Cartan, all ﬁnite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebras,
along with all their non-compact real forms, are known. Besides the inﬁnite classical series
an, bn, cn, dn, ﬁve exceptional Lie algebras exist : g2, f4, e6, e7 and e8. Gursey, Ramond
and others argued exceptional Lie algebras played a role in uniﬁcation of fundamental particles
[7]. With such studies the octonions made a return, as the algebra of their derivations is the
smallest exceptional Lie algebra g2. Moreover the maximal self-adjoint operator algebra over
the octonions, the exceptional Jordan algebra JO
3 , has the next largest exceptional Lie algebra
f4 describing its derivations [8].
Various non-compact real forms of exceptional Lie algebras play the role of electric-magnetic
duality (U-duality1) algebras in locally supersymmetric theories of gravity 2 (see e.g. [12] for
theories with 8 supersymmetries).
The largest exceptional Lie algebra e8 became central to the heterotic string [13] construc-
tion, that assigned 16 of the 26 dimensions of the bosonic string to the e8⊕ e8 even self-dual
lattice. Later, as D = 11 supergravity merged with D = 10 string theory in Witten’s [14]
mysterious M-theory, Ramond et al. noticed the D = 11 supermultiplet had a hidden f4
symmetry [15], an observation which was further investigated by Sati [16, 17]. Ramond even
1Here U-duality is referred to as the “continuous” symmetries of [9]. Their discrete versions are theU-duality
non-perturbative string theory symmetries introduced in [10].
2Some non-compact real forms of exceptional algebras also occur in absence of local supersymmetry ( cfr.
[11], and Refs. therein).

speculated whether the exceptional Jordan algebra JO
3 might be a special charge space related
to the D = 11 lightcone [18], as it has natural so(9) and f4 symmetry3. Schwarz and Kim
then recast the BFSS matrix model [20] for M-theory in terms of octonion variables [21], and
Smolin invoked the full exceptional Jordan algebra in a Chern-Simons string matrix model [22]
for Horowitz and Susskind’s conjectured “bosonic M-theory” in D = 27 [23].
With breakthroughs in algebraic geometry, coming from Connes and others in the investiga-
tion of noncommutative geometry [24, 25, 26], a program for emergent spacetime is underway
and goes beyond Riemannian geometry in favor of recovering manifolds from operator algebras.
This move to an algebraic derived spacetime proved to be novel, as it circumvented the usual
problems with Lorentz symmetry via discretization by making geometry inherently fuzzy [27].
It was even found that extended objects in string theory, D-branes, had natural coordinates
that were noncommutative [20, 28]. This made the role of C∗-algebras and K-homology of
central importance to the study of D-branes [29, 30], while also providing the spectral triples
for traditional noncommutative geometry and its applications in deriving the Standard Model
of particle physics [31, 32].
In 2007, Lisi proposed a uniﬁed model [33] using e8, which was later discovered to be
troubled [34]. However, Lisi’s theory inspired Truini to study a special star-like projection -
named “Magic Star” (MS) - of e8 under a2 [35]; also motivated by the search of a uniﬁed way
to characterize the fourth row of the Freudenthal-Rozen-Tits Magic Square [36], the Magic Star
made the structure of Jordan algebras of degree three manifest in each exceptional Lie algebra
[35] (see also [37, 38]). An interaction based model using this e8 projection has been speculated
in [35], and proposed in [39].
Our aim, in this contribution to the Proceedings of 4th Mile High Conference on Nonas-
sociative Mathematics, as well as in subsequent forthcoming works, is to deﬁne and study a
consistent generalization of exceptional Lie algebras, by crucially exploiting some remarkable
properties of the MS.
We will show how it is possible to go beyond the largest ﬁnite-dimensional exceptional Lie
algebra e8 by relying on the basic structures underlying the MS. This will result in the formula-
tion of the so-called ”Exceptional Periodicity” (EP), namely a generalization of exceptional Lie
algebras which is parametrized by a natural number n∈ N, and which also enjoys a periodicity
(ultimately traced back to the well known Bott periodicity). At each “level” of EP, namely
for each ﬁxed value of n, the dimension of the resulting algebra will be ﬁnite, raising however
the intriguing question (left for future studies) of investigating its n→∞ limit. The impetus
for the EP generalization came from certain 3- and 5- gradings of the exceptional Lie algebras,
along with spinor structures 4 beyond e8.
We will prove the existence of a periodic inﬁnite chain of ﬁnite generalisations of the ex-
ceptional structures, including e8, the Exceptional Jordan (or Albert) Algebra JO
3 , and the
octonions O themselves. Remarkably, for n = 1, the MS-shaped structure of known ﬁnite-
dimensional exceptional Lie algebras is recovered.
As it will be evident from the subsequent treatment, the price to be paid for such an
elegant and periodic, n-parametrized and MS-shaped, generalization of exceptional algebras is
that the resulting algebras will no longer be of Lie type , namely they will not satisfy Jacobi
identities anymore. Indeed, within EP we will not be dealing with root lattices, but rather
with “extended” root lattices, which will be thoroughly deﬁned further below.
It is here worth remarking that EP provides a way to go beyond e8 which is radically
3Recently, the maximally non-compact (i.e., split) real form f4(4) has been conjectured as the global symmetry
of an exotic ten-dimensional theory in the context of the study of “Magic Pyramids” [19]. See Mike Duﬀ’s talk
at this Conference.

diﬀerent from the way provided by aﬃne and (extended) Kac-Moody generalizations, such as 5
e+
8 =: e9, e++
8 =: e10,e+++
8 =: e11, which also appeared as symmetries for (super)gravity models
reduced to D = 2, 1, 0 dimensions [41, 42], respectively, as well as near spacelike singularities
in supergravity [43]. In fact, while such extensions of e8 are still of Lie type but inﬁnite-
dimensional, the generalization of exceptional Lie algebras provided by EP is not of Lie type ,
but nevertheless is ﬁnite-dimensional, for each level of the EP itself.
The paper is organized as follows.
In section 2 we recall the notions of Jordan Algebras and Pairs with particular emphasis on
their relationship with all the exceptional Lie algebras, except e8. In section 3 we introduce
the Magic Star and show its main features, among which the appearance of a triple of Jordan
Pairs at the core of e8. This is, in our opinion, the best way of expressing the link between
e8 and Jordan algebras. In sections 4, 5 and 6 we extend the features of the Magic Star,
in particular its relationship with the exceptional Lie algebras, to an inﬁnite chain of ﬁnite
dimensional algebras called Exceptional Periodicity (EP). In the case of the extension e(n)
8 of
e8, the algebra has rank N = 4(n + 1), n = 1, 2,... . In section 4 we introduce a system of
extended roots for EP, depending on n, which generalizes the root system of the exceptional
Lie algebras. In section 5 we associate an algebra, for each n, to the extended root system.
It appears as a ﬁnite dimensional generalization of the exceptional Lie algebras, in which the
Jacobi identity is only partially true. In section 6 we show that in the Magic Star for EP the
role of the Jordan algebras is played by matrix algebras, ﬁrst introduced by Vinberg [44], called
T-algebras. All in all, EP not only generalizes exceptional Lie algebras, but also the excep-
tional Jordan algebra via its T-algebra [44] structure. And, moreover, this structure is made
manifest in the MS projections of the extended root systems. In section 7 we list some future
developments on the study of EP and its applications to a model for Quantum Gravity. Most
of these developments are at an advanced stage at the time we are completing the present paper.
2 Jordan Structures and related Lie algebras
There are no Jordan algebras, there are only Lie algebras.
I. L. Kantor
The modern formulation of Jordan algebras, [45], involves a quadratic map Uxy (like xyx
for associative algebras) instead of the original symmetric product x·y = 1
2(xy +yx), [2]. The
quadratic map and its linearization Vx,yz = (Ux+z−Ux−Uz)y (likexyz +zyx in the associative
case) reveal the mathematical structure of Jordan Algebras much more clearly, through the
notion of inverse, inner ideal, generic norm, etc. The quadratic formulation is also particularly
suited for the connection with Lie algebras, as we will explain in the next section. The axioms
for (quadratic) Jordan algebras are:
U1 =Id , U xVy,x =Vx,yUx , U Uxy =UxUyUx (2.1)
The quadratic formulation led to the concept of Jordan Triple systems [46], an example of
which is a pair of modules represented by rectangular matrices. There is no way of multiplying
two matricesx andy , say n×m andm×n respectively, by means of a bilinear product. But
one can do it using a product like xyx, quadratic in x and linear in y. Notice that, like in the
case of rectangular matrices, there needs not be a unity in these structures. The axioms are in
this case:
UxVy,x =Vx,yUx , V Uxy,y =Vx,Uyx , U Uxy =UxUyUx (2.2)
5For recent development on e11 and beyond, see [40].

Finally, a Jordan Pair is deﬁned just as a pair of modules ( V +,V −) acting on each other
(but not on themselves) like a Jordan Triple:
UxσVy−σ,xσ =Vxσ,y−σUxσ
VUxσy−σ,y−σ =Vxσ,Uy−σxσ
UUxσy−σ =UxσUy−σUxσ
(2.3)
where σ =± and xσ∈V +σ, y−σ∈V−σ.
Jordan Pairs are strongly related to the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction of Lie Algebras
L [47]-[49] (see also the interesting relation to Hopf algebras, [50]):
L =J⊕ str(J)⊕ ¯J (2.4)
where J is a Jordan algebra and str( J) = L(J)⊕Der(J) is the structure algebra of J [51];
L(x) is the left multiplication in J: L(x)y = x·y and Der(J) = [L(J),L (J)] is the algebra of
derivations of J (the algebra of the automorphism group of J) [52][53].
In the case of complex exceptional Lie algebras, this construction applies to e7, with J =
J8
3≡ JO
3 , the 27-dimensional exceptional Jordan algebra of 3 × 3 Hermitian matrices over the
complex octonions, and str(J) = e6⊗C - C denoting the complex ﬁeld. The algebra e6 is called
the reduced structure algebra of J, str 0(J), namely the structure algebra with the generator
corresponding to the multiplication by a complex number taken away: e6 = L(J0)⊕Der(J),
with J0 denoting the traceless elements of J.
Let us focus on exceptional Jordan and Lie algebras. We consider the Jordan algebras and
Pairs based on the 3× 3 matrices Jννν
3,ννν = 1, 2, 4, 8:
Jννν
3 :=


α a ¯b
¯a β c
b ¯c γ

 α,β,γ ∈ C ; a,b,c ∈ A
ννν = 1, 2, 4, 8 for A = R, C, H, O (2.5)
where R, C, H, O denote the Hurwitz algebras of reals, complex, quaternions and octonions,
respectively.
Ifx,y∈ Jννν
3 andxy denotes their standard matrix product, we denote by x·y := 1
2(xy +yx) the
Jordan product of x andy. The Jordan identity is the power associativity with respect to this
product:
x2·(x·z)−x·(x2·z) = 0, (2.6)
Another fundamental product is the sharp product #, [51]. It is the linearization of x# :=
x2−t(x)x− 1
2(t(x2)−t(x)2)I, with t(x) denoting the trace of x∈ Jννν
3, in terms of which we
may write the fundamental cubic identity for Jννν
3,ννν = 1, 2, 4, 8:
x#·x = 1
3t(x#,x )I or x3−t(x)x2 +t(x#)x− 1
3t(x#,x )I = 0 (2.7)
where we use the notation t(x,y ) := t(x·y) and x3 = x2·x (notice that for J8
3, because of
non-associativity,x2x̸=xx2 in general).
The triple product is deﬁned as, [51]:
{x,y,z} :=Vx,yz : = t(x,y )z +t(z,y )x− (x#z)#y
= 2 [(x·y)·z + (y·z)·x− (z·x)·y] (2.8)
Notice that the last equality of (2.8) is not trivial at all. Vx,yz is the linearization of the
quadratic map Uxy. The equation (2.3.15) at page 484 of [51] shows that:
Uxy =t(x,y )x−x##y = 2(x·y)·x−x2·y (2.9)
