ABSTRACT
We present a periodic inﬁnite chain of ﬁnite generalisations of the exceptional structures, in-
cluding e8, the exceptional Jordan algebra (and pair), and the octonions. We demonstrate that
the exceptional Jordan algebra is part of an inﬁnite family of ﬁnite-dimensional matrix algebras
(corresponding to a particular class of cubic Vinberg’s T-algebras). Correspondingly, we prove
that e8 is part of an inﬁnite family of algebras (dubbed “Magic Star” algebras) that resemble
lattice vertex algebras.

1 Introduction
In the mind of every mathematician, there is a tension between the general rule and exceptional
cases. Our conscience tells us we should strive for general theorems, yet we are fascinated and
seduced by beautiful exceptions.
J. Stillwell [1]
Since the inception of quantum mechanics operator algebras and their symmetries have
proved to be of central importance. Jordan, Wigner and von Neumann [2], in a rigorous
exploration of extended forms of quantum mechanics, classiﬁed ﬁnite dimensional self-adjoint
operator algebras, now known as formally real Jordan algebras. The exceptional case they found
contained the largest division algebra, the octonions O [3], ﬁrst discovered by J. T. Graves in
1843.
With Gell-Mann’s Eightfold way [4], and subsequent study of the su3 quark and gluon
structures [5, 6], Lie algebras solidiﬁed a ﬁrm role in the study of elementary particles. After
the classiﬁcations by Killing and Cartan, all ﬁnite-dimensional complex simple Lie algebras,
along with all their non-compact real forms, are known. Besides the inﬁnite classical series
an, bn, cn, dn, ﬁve exceptional Lie algebras exist : g2, f4, e6, e7 and e8. Gursey, Ramond
and others argued exceptional Lie algebras played a role in uniﬁcation of fundamental particles
[7]. With such studies the octonions made a return, as the algebra of their derivations is the
smallest exceptional Lie algebra g2. Moreover the maximal self-adjoint operator algebra over
the octonions, the exceptional Jordan algebra JO
3 , has the next largest exceptional Lie algebra
f4 describing its derivations [8].
Various non-compact real forms of exceptional Lie algebras play the role of electric-magnetic
duality (U-duality1) algebras in locally supersymmetric theories of gravity 2 (see e.g. [12] for
theories with 8 supersymmetries).
The largest exceptional Lie algebra e8 became central to the heterotic string [13] construc-
tion, that assigned 16 of the 26 dimensions of the bosonic string to the e8⊕ e8 even self-dual
lattice. Later, as D = 11 supergravity merged with D = 10 string theory in Witten’s [14]
mysterious M-theory, Ramond et al. noticed the D = 11 supermultiplet had a hidden f4
symmetry [15], an observation which was further investigated by Sati [16, 17]. Ramond even
1Here U-duality is referred to as the “continuous” symmetries of [9]. Their discrete versions are theU-duality
non-perturbative string theory symmetries introduced in [10].
2Some non-compact real forms of exceptional algebras also occur in absence of local supersymmetry ( cfr.
[11], and Refs. therein).

speculated whether the exceptional Jordan algebra JO
3 might be a special charge space related
to the D = 11 lightcone [18], as it has natural so(9) and f4 symmetry3. Schwarz and Kim
then recast the BFSS matrix model [20] for M-theory in terms of octonion variables [21], and
Smolin invoked the full exceptional Jordan algebra in a Chern-Simons string matrix model [22]
for Horowitz and Susskind’s conjectured “bosonic M-theory” in D = 27 [23].
With breakthroughs in algebraic geometry, coming from Connes and others in the investiga-
tion of noncommutative geometry [24, 25, 26], a program for emergent spacetime is underway
and goes beyond Riemannian geometry in favor of recovering manifolds from operator algebras.
This move to an algebraic derived spacetime proved to be novel, as it circumvented the usual
problems with Lorentz symmetry via discretization by making geometry inherently fuzzy [27].
It was even found that extended objects in string theory, D-branes, had natural coordinates
that were noncommutative [20, 28]. This made the role of C∗-algebras and K-homology of
central importance to the study of D-branes [29, 30], while also providing the spectral triples
for traditional noncommutative geometry and its applications in deriving the Standard Model
of particle physics [31, 32].
In 2007, Lisi proposed a uniﬁed model [33] using e8, which was later discovered to be
troubled [34]. However, Lisi’s theory inspired Truini to study a special star-like projection -
named “Magic Star” (MS) - of e8 under a2 [35]; also motivated by the search of a uniﬁed way
to characterize the fourth row of the Freudenthal-Rozen-Tits Magic Square [36], the Magic Star
made the structure of Jordan algebras of degree three manifest in each exceptional Lie algebra
[35] (see also [37, 38]). An interaction based model using this e8 projection has been speculated
in [35], and proposed in [39].
Our aim, in this contribution to the Proceedings of 4th Mile High Conference on Nonas-
sociative Mathematics, as well as in subsequent forthcoming works, is to deﬁne and study a
consistent generalization of exceptional Lie algebras, by crucially exploiting some remarkable
properties of the MS.
We will show how it is possible to go beyond the largest ﬁnite-dimensional exceptional Lie
algebra e8 by relying on the basic structures underlying the MS. This will result in the formula-
tion of the so-called ”Exceptional Periodicity” (EP), namely a generalization of exceptional Lie
algebras which is parametrized by a natural number n∈ N, and which also enjoys a periodicity
(ultimately traced back to the well known Bott periodicity). At each “level” of EP, namely
for each ﬁxed value of n, the dimension of the resulting algebra will be ﬁnite, raising however
the intriguing question (left for future studies) of investigating its n→∞ limit. The impetus
for the EP generalization came from certain 3- and 5- gradings of the exceptional Lie algebras,
along with spinor structures 4 beyond e8.
We will prove the existence of a periodic inﬁnite chain of ﬁnite generalisations of the ex-
ceptional structures, including e8, the Exceptional Jordan (or Albert) Algebra JO
3 , and the
octonions O themselves. Remarkably, for n = 1, the MS-shaped structure of known ﬁnite-
dimensional exceptional Lie algebras is recovered.
As it will be evident from the subsequent treatment, the price to be paid for such an
elegant and periodic, n-parametrized and MS-shaped, generalization of exceptional algebras is
that the resulting algebras will no longer be of Lie type , namely they will not satisfy Jacobi
identities anymore. Indeed, within EP we will not be dealing with root lattices, but rather
with “extended” root lattices, which will be thoroughly deﬁned further below.
It is here worth remarking that EP provides a way to go beyond e8 which is radically
3Recently, the maximally non-compact (i.e., split) real form f4(4) has been conjectured as the global symmetry
of an exotic ten-dimensional theory in the context of the study of “Magic Pyramids” [19]. See Mike Duﬀ’s talk
at this Conference.

diﬀerent from the way provided by aﬃne and (extended) Kac-Moody generalizations, such as 5
e+
8 =: e9, e++
8 =: e10,e+++
8 =: e11, which also appeared as symmetries for (super)gravity models
reduced to D = 2, 1, 0 dimensions [41, 42], respectively, as well as near spacelike singularities
in supergravity [43]. In fact, while such extensions of e8 are still of Lie type but inﬁnite-
dimensional, the generalization of exceptional Lie algebras provided by EP is not of Lie type ,
but nevertheless is ﬁnite-dimensional, for each level of the EP itself.
The paper is organized as follows.
In section 2 we recall the notions of Jordan Algebras and Pairs with particular emphasis on
their relationship with all the exceptional Lie algebras, except e8. In section 3 we introduce
the Magic Star and show its main features, among which the appearance of a triple of Jordan
Pairs at the core of e8. This is, in our opinion, the best way of expressing the link between
e8 and Jordan algebras. In sections 4, 5 and 6 we extend the features of the Magic Star,
in particular its relationship with the exceptional Lie algebras, to an inﬁnite chain of ﬁnite
dimensional algebras called Exceptional Periodicity (EP). In the case of the extension e(n)
8 of
e8, the algebra has rank N = 4(n + 1), n = 1, 2,... . In section 4 we introduce a system of
extended roots for EP, depending on n, which generalizes the root system of the exceptional
Lie algebras. In section 5 we associate an algebra, for each n, to the extended root system.
It appears as a ﬁnite dimensional generalization of the exceptional Lie algebras, in which the
Jacobi identity is only partially true. In section 6 we show that in the Magic Star for EP the
role of the Jordan algebras is played by matrix algebras, ﬁrst introduced by Vinberg [44], called
T-algebras. All in all, EP not only generalizes exceptional Lie algebras, but also the excep-
tional Jordan algebra via its T-algebra [44] structure. And, moreover, this structure is made
manifest in the MS projections of the extended root systems. In section 7 we list some future
developments on the study of EP and its applications to a model for Quantum Gravity. Most
of these developments are at an advanced stage at the time we are completing the present paper.
2 Jordan Structures and related Lie algebras
There are no Jordan algebras, there are only Lie algebras.
I. L. Kantor
The modern formulation of Jordan algebras, [45], involves a quadratic map Uxy (like xyx
for associative algebras) instead of the original symmetric product x·y = 1
2(xy +yx), [2]. The
quadratic map and its linearization Vx,yz = (Ux+z−Ux−Uz)y (likexyz +zyx in the associative
case) reveal the mathematical structure of Jordan Algebras much more clearly, through the
notion of inverse, inner ideal, generic norm, etc. The quadratic formulation is also particularly
suited for the connection with Lie algebras, as we will explain in the next section. The axioms
for (quadratic) Jordan algebras are:
U1 =Id , U xVy,x =Vx,yUx , U Uxy =UxUyUx (2.1)
The quadratic formulation led to the concept of Jordan Triple systems [46], an example of
which is a pair of modules represented by rectangular matrices. There is no way of multiplying
two matricesx andy , say n×m andm×n respectively, by means of a bilinear product. But
one can do it using a product like xyx, quadratic in x and linear in y. Notice that, like in the
case of rectangular matrices, there needs not be a unity in these structures. The axioms are in
this case:
UxVy,x =Vx,yUx , V Uxy,y =Vx,Uyx , U Uxy =UxUyUx (2.2)
5For recent development on e11 and beyond, see [40].

--- page 5 ---
Finally, a Jordan Pair is deﬁned just as a pair of modules ( V +,V −) acting on each other
(but not on themselves) like a Jordan Triple:
UxσVy−σ,xσ =Vxσ,y−σUxσ
VUxσy−σ,y−σ =Vxσ,Uy−σxσ
UUxσy−σ =UxσUy−σUxσ
(2.3)
where σ =± and xσ∈V +σ, y−σ∈V−σ.
Jordan Pairs are strongly related to the Tits-Kantor-Koecher construction of Lie Algebras
L [47]-[49] (see also the interesting relation to Hopf algebras, [50]):
L =J⊕ str(J)⊕ ¯J (2.4)
where J is a Jordan algebra and str( J) = L(J)⊕Der(J) is the structure algebra of J [51];
L(x) is the left multiplication in J: L(x)y = x·y and Der(J) = [L(J),L (J)] is the algebra of
derivations of J (the algebra of the automorphism group of J) [52][53].
In the case of complex exceptional Lie algebras, this construction applies to e7, with J =
J8
3≡ JO
3 , the 27-dimensional exceptional Jordan algebra of 3 × 3 Hermitian matrices over the
complex octonions, and str(J) = e6⊗C - C denoting the complex ﬁeld. The algebra e6 is called
the reduced structure algebra of J, str 0(J), namely the structure algebra with the generator
corresponding to the multiplication by a complex number taken away: e6 = L(J0)⊕Der(J),
with J0 denoting the traceless elements of J.
Let us focus on exceptional Jordan and Lie algebras. We consider the Jordan algebras and
Pairs based on the 3× 3 matrices Jννν
3,ννν = 1, 2, 4, 8:
Jννν
3 :=


α a ¯b
¯a β c
b ¯c γ

 α,β,γ ∈ C ; a,b,c ∈ A
ννν = 1, 2, 4, 8 for A = R, C, H, O (2.5)
where R, C, H, O denote the Hurwitz algebras of reals, complex, quaternions and octonions,
respectively.
Ifx,y∈ Jννν
3 andxy denotes their standard matrix product, we denote by x·y := 1
2(xy +yx) the
Jordan product of x andy. The Jordan identity is the power associativity with respect to this
product:
x2·(x·z)−x·(x2·z) = 0, (2.6)
Another fundamental product is the sharp product #, [51]. It is the linearization of x# :=
x2−t(x)x− 1
2(t(x2)−t(x)2)I, with t(x) denoting the trace of x∈ Jννν
3, in terms of which we
may write the fundamental cubic identity for Jννν
3,ννν = 1, 2, 4, 8:
x#·x = 1
3t(x#,x )I or x3−t(x)x2 +t(x#)x− 1
3t(x#,x )I = 0 (2.7)
where we use the notation t(x,y ) := t(x·y) and x3 = x2·x (notice that for J8
3, because of
non-associativity,x2x̸=xx2 in general).
The triple product is deﬁned as, [51]:
{x,y,z} :=Vx,yz : = t(x,y )z +t(z,y )x− (x#z)#y
= 2 [(x·y)·z + (y·z)·x− (z·x)·y] (2.8)
Notice that the last equality of (2.8) is not trivial at all. Vx,yz is the linearization of the
quadratic map Uxy. The equation (2.3.15) at page 484 of [51] shows that:
Uxy =t(x,y )x−x##y = 2(x·y)·x−x2·y (2.9)
4

--- page 6 ---
The following identities can be derived from the Jordan Pair axioms, [54]:
[Vx,y,Vz,w] =VVx,yz,w−Vz,Vx,yw (2.10)
and, for D = (D+,D−) a derivation of the Jordan Pair V and β(x,y ) = (Vx,y,−Vy,x),
[D,β (x,y )] =β(D+(x),y ) +β(x,D−(y)) (2.11)
We have: For JP := (J, ¯J): str(J) =Der(JP )
Ux+y− = [[x+,y−],x +] ; Ux−y+ = [[x−,y +],x−]
JP axioms follow from the Jacobi identity of the Lie algebra str(J).
To summarize the relationship between the exceptional Jordan algebra and the exceptional
Lie algebras is:
g2 =Der(O)
f4 =Der(J8
3) ; Der(J) = [L(J),L (J)]
e6 =stro(J8
3) =L(J0)⊕Der(J) =Dero(J8

3)
e7 = J8

e8 = ?
The link between e8 and Jordan Algebras and Pairs is expressed, in our opinion, by the
Magic Star, [35].

structures
The star that can bring peace and order back to the chaotic world.
citation from the “Magic Star” TV series, China, 2017.
The Magic Star, [35] [37], shown in Figure 1, is the projection of the roots of the exceptional
Lie algebras on a complex su(3) = a2 plane, recognizable by the dots forming the external
hexagon, and it exhibits the Jordan Pair content of each exceptional Lie algebra. There are
three Jordan Pairs ( Jννν
3, J3
ννν), each of which lies on an axis symmetrically with respect to the
center of the diagram. Each pair doubles a simple Jordan algebra of rank 3, Jννν
3, with involution
- the conjugate representation J3
ννν, which is the algebra of 3 × 3 Hermitian matrices over A,
where A = R, C, H, O for ννν = 1, 2, 4, 8 respectively. The exceptional Lie algebras f4, e6, e7,
e8 are obtained forννν = 1, 2, 4, 8, respectively. g2 can be also represented in the same way, with
the Jordan algebra reduced to a single element. The Jordan algebras Jννν
3 (and their conjugate
J3
ννν) globally behave like a 3 (and a 3) dimensional representation of the outer a2. The algebra
denoted by gννν
0 in the center (plus the Cartan generator associated with the axis along which
the pair lies) is the algebra of the automorphism group of the Jordan Pair; namely, gννν
0 is the
the reduced structure group of the corresponding Jordan algebra Jννν
3: gννν
0 = str0 (Jννν
3).
The base ﬁeld considered throughout the present paper is C. The various real compact and
non-compact forms of the exceptional Lie algebras follow as a consequence, using some more
or less laborious tricks, whose treatment we leave to a future study, and they do not aﬀect the

essential structure.
What is magic in the Magic Star? Let us list a number of features which are clearly shown
by the picture.
1) The Magic Star represents a unifying view of all the exceptional algebras.
2) Since Dero(J2
3, J2
3) = a2⊕ a2 and Dero(J8
3, J8
3) = e6, Figure 1 depicts the following
decomposition, [35] :
e8 = ac
2 + (3, J8
3) + (¯3, J8
3) +Dero(J8
3, J8
3)
= ac
2 + (3, J8
3) + (¯3, J8
3) + af
2 + (3, J2
3) + (¯3, J2
3) +Dero(J2
3, J2
3)
= ac
2 + (3, J8
3) + (¯3, J8
3) + af
2 + (3, J2
3) + (¯3, J2
3) + a(1)
2 + a(2)
2
(3.1)
which shows that e8 is made of 4 orthogonal a2 subalgebras, plus 3 Jordan Pairs (J8
3, J8
3)
over the octonions, plus 3 Jordan Pairs ( J2
3, J2
3) over the complex. The role of the a2’s is
interchangeable: any a2 would produce a Magic Star. Select one and call it ac
2 for color
a2 and another one, af
2, inside e6 as ﬂavor a2, then the Jordan Pairs in 3.1 represent three
families of colored and three families of ﬂavor degrees of freedom (notice that the ﬂavor
part is a singlet of ac
2).The two remaining a2’s may be related to gravity. We are currently
working on this aspect with the hope to produce an e8 model of quantum gravity with
an emergent discrete spacetime.
3) By considering a Jordan Pair ( J8
3, J8
3) plus e6⊕ C we get the 3-graded Lie algebra e7,
clearly shown in Figure 2. This shows why quadratic maps and Jordan Pairs are the
natural Jordan product and structure inside e8: Uxσy−σ = [[xσ,y−σ],xσ] , σ =±
whereas [xσ,yσ] = 0 as clearly shown by the 3-grading.
4) Other important algebraic structures easily visible in the Magic Star are related to the 5-
grading of e8: the Freudenthal Triple Systems (FTS), [55], in the case of e8 an irreducible
56-dimensional irreducible representation of e7, and the Kantor Pair, [56], formed by two
FTS’. They are shown in Figure 3. Denoting g = g−2 + g−1 + g0 + g1 + g2 the 5-grading,
we have e7 in grade 0 = Der(FTS ), an FTS in grade 1 (a 56-dim irrep of e7) and 1-
dimensional g±2 := Cx±ρ. The non-deg skew bilinear <, > and a fully symmetric quartic

Figure 3: FTS (left) and KP (right) within e8
form q on g1, characteristic of the FTS, are obtained by:
[x,y ] = <x,y >x ρ x,y∈ g1
q(x,x,x,x ) = [ x, [x, [x, [x,x−ρ]]]] x∈ g1
(3.2)
from which⇒q(xβ1,xβ2,xβ3,xβ4) follows by linearization.
The Kantor Pair is a pair of modules and within e8 is
KP = e8⊖ (e7⊕ a1)
4 Exceptional Periodicity and Extended Roots
Divinity drew Earth out of Emptiness as he drew One from Nothing to create many.
Pythagoras
We force the deﬁnition of root system to include what we call extended roots not obeying
the symmetry by Weyl reﬂection, nor the fact that 2 (α,β )
(α,α ) be integer for all roots α, β.
7

--- page 9 ---
Let{k1,...,k N} be an orthonormal basis of an Euclidean space V of dimension N. For any
n = 1, 2,... we introduce N = 4(n + 1) and deﬁne the extended roots of e(n)
8 as:
e(n)
8 :
±ki±kj 1≤i<j ≤N 2N(N− 1) roots
1
2(±k1±k2±...±kN) even # of + 2 N−1 roots (4.1)
This is a root system only in the case n = 1 and e8(1) = e8.
The extended roots of g(n)
2 are obtained by projecting on the space spanned by k1−k2
and k1 +k2− 2k3, hence g(n)
2 = g2; those of f (n)
4 are the projection on the space spanned by
k1,k 2,...,k N−4:
f (n)
4 :
±ki ,±ki±kj 1≤i<j ≤N− 4
1
2(±k1±k2±...±kN−4) (4.2)
and ﬁnally:
e(n)
6 :
±ki±kj 1≤i<j ≤N− 3
1
2(±k1±k2±...± (kN−2 +kN−1 +kN)) even # of + (4.3)
e(n)
7 :
±(kN−1 +kN)
±ki±kj 1≤i<j ≤N− 2
1
2(±k1±k2±...± (kN−1 +kN)) even # of +
(4.4)
Figure 4: The Magic Star
All these sets of extended roots form a Magic star of ﬁgure 4, once projected on the plane
spanned byk1−k2 andk1 +k2−2k3. In the ﬁgure the pair of integers (a,b ) are the (Euclidean)
scalar products of each root with k1−k2 and k1 +k2− 2k3.

--- page 10 ---
One can readily check that, upon a relabeling of the k’s, e(n)
6 is the center of the Magic Star
of e(n)
8 and that e(n)
7 = e(n)
6 ⊕T(a,b)⊕T(−a,−b), for a ﬁxed pair ( a,b )∈{ (1, 1), (−1, 1), (0,−2)},
where e(n)
6 is the center of the Magic Star and T(a,b) is the set of roots of e(n)
8 whose scalar
products with k1−k2 and k1 +k2− 2k3 are (a,b ).
The rank of g(n)
2 , f (n)
4 , e(n)
6 , e(n)
7 , e(n)
8 is the dimension of the vector space V spanned by
their roots, namely 2, N− 4, N− 2, N− 1, N respectively.
By abuse of deﬁnition we shall often say root, for short, instead of extended root.
From now on we restrict to e(n)
6 , e(n)
7 , e(n)
8 and denote byLMS anyone of them, by Φ the set
of extended roots of LMS and by R its rank. We recall that N = 4(n + 1),n = 1, 2,... , hence
R =N− 2 = 4n + 2 for e(n)
6 , R =N− 1 = 4n + 3 for e(n)
7 , R =N = 4n + 4 for e(n)
8 .
We denote by ΦO and ΦS the following subsets of Φ:
ΦO ={(±ki±kj)∈ Φ}
ΦS ={ 1
2(±k1±k2±...±kN)∈ Φ}
(4.5)
Remark 4.1. Notice that ΦO is the root system of dN−3 in the case of e(n)
6 , of dN−2⊕a1 in
the case of e(n)
7 and of dN in the case of e(n)
8 .
We now prove the following results.
Proposition 4.2. For all ρ∈ ΦO and x∈ Φ: 2(x,ρ )
(ρ,ρ )∈ Z and wρ(x) = x− 2(x,ρ )
(ρ,ρ )ρ∈ Φ (the
set of extended roots is closed under the Weyl reﬂections by all ρ∈ ΦO). The set of extended
roots is closed under the Weyl reﬂections by all ρ∈ Φ if and only if n = 1.
Proof. If ρ∈ ΦO then (ρ,ρ ) = 2 and ( x,ρ )∈{ 0,±1,±2}, hence 2 (x,ρ )
(ρ,ρ ) ∈ Z and wρ(x) =
x− (x,ρ )ρ. If ( x,ρ ) = 0 then wρ(x) = x∈ Φ. If ( x,ρ ) =±1 then wρ(x) = x∓ρ∈ Φ as we
shall prove in proposition 4.4. If ( x,ρ ) = ±2 then ρ =±x and wρ(x) = −x∈ Φ. Suppose
now that both x,ρ∈ ΦS and write x = 1
2
∑λiki, ρ = 1
2
∑µiki where λi,µi∈{− 1, 1}. We can
certainly pick an x such that (x,ρ ) =−n which occurs whenever for two indices j,ℓ λj = µj
and λℓ =µℓ while λi =−µi for i̸=j,ℓ . Hence wρ(x) =x + 2 n
n + 1ρ = 1
2
∑νiki. We have that
|νj| =
⏐⏐⏐⏐λj + 2 n
n + 1µj
⏐⏐⏐⏐ = 3n + 1
n + 1 ≥ 2 and|νj| = 2 if and only if n = 1, in which case Φ is the
root system of a simple Lie algebra. For n> 1 there is no root with such a coeﬃcient νj.
We introduce the basis ∆ = {α1,...,α R} of Φ, with αi = ki− ki+1, 1 ≤ i ≤ R− 2,
αR−1 =kR−2 +kR−1 and αR =− 1
2(k1 +k2 +... +kN); we order them by setting αi >α i+1:
∆ ={k1−k2,k 2−k3,...,k R−2−kR−1,kR−2 +kR−1,− 1
2(k1 +k2 +... +kN)} (4.6)
Proposition 4.3. The set ∆ in (4.6) is a set of simple extended roots, by which we mean:
i) ∆ is a basis of the Euclidean space V of ﬁnite dimension R;
ii) every root β can be written as a linear combination of roots of ∆ with all positive or all
negative integer coeﬃcients: β =∑ℓiαi with ℓi≥ 0 or ℓi≤ 0 for all i.

For all roots β =∑R
i=1miαi the coeﬃcient mR is such that:
mR∈{ 0,±2} if β∈ ΦO
mR =±1 if β∈ ΦS (4.7)
Proof. The set ∆ ={α1,...,α R} is obviously a basis in V . Let u =kN−2 +kN−1 +kN,kN−1 +

(4.11)
We see that all the roots in (4.9),(4.10),(4.11) are the sum of simple roots with all positive
integer coeﬃcients. These are half of the roots in Φ O and they are all positive roots.
The rest of the roots in ΦO are negative and are obviously the sum of simple roots with integer
coeﬃcients that are all negative.
Finally all the roots in Φ S that contain− 1
2u can be obtained from αR by ﬂipping an even
number of signs and this is done by adding to αR a certain number of terms of the type ki +kj,
1≤ i < j≤ R− 1. These are all positive roots, a half of the roots in Φ S and are linear
combination of simple roots with integer coeﬃcients that are all positive.
The negative roots are similarly obtained by adding to −αN a certain numeber of terms of the
type−(ki +kj), 1≤ i < j≤ R− 1, and are linear combination of simple roots with integer
coeﬃcients that are all negative.
As an consequence we easily obtain 4.7.
Proposition 4.4. For each α∈ ΦO,β ∈ Φ the scalar product (α,β )∈{± 2,±1, 0}; α +β (
respectivelyα−β) is a root if and only if (α,β ) =−1 (respectively +1); if both α +β andα−β
are not in Φ∪{ 0} then (α,β ) = 0.
For eachα,β ∈ ΦS the scalar product (α,β )∈{± (n+1),±n,±(n−1),..., 0};α+β ( respectively
α−β) is a root if and only if (α,β ) =−n (respectively +n).
Forα,β ∈ Φ if α +β is a root then α−β is not a root.
10

Proof. If both α,β ∈ ΦO the proof follows from the fact that Φ O is the root system of a
simply laced Lie algebra. If α∈ ΦO,β ∈ ΦS then obviously ( α,β )∈ {±1, 0}. Moreover,
let us write α = σiki +σjkj, i < j, σi,j ∈{− 1, 1}. Then ( α,β ) = −1 if and only if β =
1
2(±k1±...−σiki±...−σjkj±...±kN), which is true if and only if α +β∈ Φ (in particular
α +β ∈ ΦS). Similarly ( α,β ) = 1 if and only if α−β ∈ Φ. As a consequence, if both
α±β /∈ Φ∪{ 0} then (α,β )̸=±1 and also ( α,β )̸=±2 because (α,β ) =±2 if and only if
α =±β; therefore (α,β ) = 0.
If both α,β ∈ ΦS, then all their signs but an even number 2m must be equal, m = 0,...,N/ 2 =
2(n + 1) and we get (α,β ) = 1
4(N− 2m− 2m) = n + 1−m =n + 1,n,n − 1,...,−(n + 1) for
m = 0,..., 2(n + 1). Moreover, since ±ki±ki∈{ 0,±2ki}, i = 1,...N then α +β∈ Φ if and
only if all signs are opposite but 2 (in which case α +β is actually in Φ O) and this is true if
and only if (α,β ) =− 1
4(N− 4) =−n. Similarly (α,β ) =n if and only if α−β∈ Φ. The last
statement of the Proposition follows trivially.
The preceding propositions extend to EP analogous results for the root system of simply
laced Lie algebras. They are essential in determining the structure of the algebra LMS that we
associate to the extended roots in the next section.
5 The LMS algebra
Mathematics is the art of giving the same name to diﬀerent things.
H. Poincar´ e
We deﬁne theLMS algebra (as before LMS is either e(n)
6 or e(n)
7 or e(n)
8 ) by extending the
construction of a Lie algebra from a root system, [57] [58] [59]. In particular we generalize the
algorithm in [59] for simply laced Lee algebras, since also in our set of extended roots the β
chain through α, namely the set of roots α +cβ, c∈ Z, has length one.
We giveLMS an algebra structure of rank R over a ﬁeld extension F of the rational integers
Z in the following way 6 :
a) we select the set of simple extended roots ∆ = {α1,...,α R} of Φ
b) we select a basis {h1,...,h R} of the R-dimensional vector space H over F and set hα =∑R
i=1cihi for each α∈ Φ such that α =∑R
i=1ciαi
c) we associate to each α∈ Φ a one-dimensional vector space Lα over F spanned by xα
d) we deﬁne LMS =H⨁
α∈ΦLα as a vector space over F
e) we give LMS an algebraic structure by deﬁning the following multiplication on the basis
BLS ={h1,...,h R}∪{ xα| α∈ Φ}, extended by linearity to a bilinear multiplication
LMS×L MS→L MS:
[hi,hj] = 0 , 1≤i,j ≤R
[hi,xα] =−[xα,hi] = (α,αi)xα , 1≤i≤R , α∈ Φ
[xα,x−α] =−hα
[xα,xβ] = 0 for α,β ∈ Φ such that α +β /∈ Φ and α̸=−β
[xα,xβ] =ε(α,β )xα+β for α,β ∈ Φ such that α +β∈ Φ
(5.1)
6Speciﬁcally, we will take F to be the complex ﬁeld C.

whereε(α,β ) is the asymmetry function, introduced in [60], see also [59], deﬁned as follows:
Deﬁnition 5.1. Let L denote the lattice of all linear combinations of the simple extended roots
with integer coeﬃcients
L =
{ R∑
i=1
ciαi| ci∈ Z , αi∈ ∆
}
(5.2)
the asymmetry function ε(α,β ) : L× L→{− 1, 1} is deﬁned by:
ε(α,β ) =




−1 if i =j
−1 if αi +αj is a root and αi <α j
+1 otherwise
(5.4)
We now show some properties of the asymmetry function. In particular we show that, for
α,β,α +β∈ Φ, ε(α,β ) =−ε(β,α ) which implies that the bilinear product (5.1) is antisym-
metric.
Proposition 5.2. The asymmetry function ε satisﬁes, for α,β,γ,δ ∈ L, α = ∑miαi and
β =∑niαi:
i) ε(α +β,γ ) = ε(α,γ )ε(β,γ )
ii) ε(α,γ +δ) = ε(α,γ )ε(α,δ )
iii) ε(α,α ) = ( −1)

R

iv) ε(α,β )ε(β,α ) = ( −1)(α,β)−mRnR(n−1)
v) ε(0,β ) = ε(α, 0) = 1
vi) ε(−α,β ) = ε(α,β )−1 =ε(α,β )
vii) ε(α,−β) = ε(α,β )−1 =ε(α,β )
Proof. The ﬁrst two properties follow directly from the deﬁnition. In order to prove iii) we
ﬁrst notice that for αi,αj∈ ∆ , i̸=j, (αi,αj)∈{ 0,−1}. Therefore:
ε(α,α ) = ∏
1≤i,j≤Rε(αi,αj)mimj =∏

(5.5)
Property iv) follows from iii) by replacing α with α +β and using the ﬁrst two. If α =∑miαi, β =∑niαi and α +β =∑ℓiαi =∑(mi +ni)αi we get:
ε(α +β,α +β) = ( −1)

(5.6)
from which the property follows. Property v) is a trivial consequence of the deﬁnition, whereas
properties vi) and vii) follow from property v) together with i) and ii).
12

Proposition 5.3. If α,β,α +β∈ Φ then:
i) ε(α,α ) =−1 α∈ Φ
ii) ε(α,β ) =−ε(β,α ) α,β, (α +β)∈ Φ antisymmetry
iii) ε(α,β ) =ε(β,α +β) if α,α +β∈ Φ, β∈ L
iv) ε(α,β ) =ε(β,α−β) if α,α−β∈ Φ, β∈ L
Proof. By (4.7) if α∈ ΦO then (α,α ) = 2 and m2
R/2 is even, hence ε(α,α ) =−1. If α∈ ΦS
then (α,α ) = n + 1 and m2
R = 1. Therefore if ( −1)

As a consequence, if α,β,α +β ∈ Φ, then −1 = ε(α +β,α +β) = ε(α,β )ε(β,α ), hence
ε(α,β ) =−ε(β,α )
Finally we prove iii) - similar proof for iv):
ε(α,β ) =ε(α,α−α +β) =ε(α,α )ε(α,α +β) =−ε(α +β−β,α +β) =ε(β,α +β)
6 T-algebras
The essence of Mathematics lies in its freedom.
G. Cantor
We now concentrate on the set of roots T(a,b) on a tip of the Magic Star. In order to ﬁx one,
let us considerT(1,1) and denote it simply byT . The reader will forgive us if we shall be concise
whenever there is no risk of misunderstanding and useT to denote both the set of roots and the
set of elements in LMS associated to those roots. An element of T is an F-linear combination
of xα,xβ,... for α,β,... in T(1,1). We give T an algebraic structure with a symmetric product,
thus mimicking the case n = 1 when T is a Jordan algebra.
Let us ﬁrst show what happens in the case n = 1, in particular for e8. It is proven in [37]
thatT =J(1,1) is the Jordan Algebra J8
3 of 3× 3 Hermitean matrices over the octonions O. Let
us denote by P1 := E11, P2 := E22, P3 := E33 the three trace-one idempotents, whose sum is
the identity in J8
3,Eii representing the matrix with a 1 in the ( ii) position and zero elsewhere.
Let us identify the algebra d4⊂ f4⊂ e6⊂ e6⊕ ac
2⊂ e8 with the roots±ki±kj, 4≤i<j ≤ 7
and P1,P 2,P 3 with the elements of J(1,1) which are left invariant by d4, [61]. This uniquely
identiﬁesP1,P 2,P 3 with the roots k1 +k8,k1−k8 and−k2−k3. Since e7⊂ e8 is 3-graded, one
can deﬁne a 3-linear product on J(1,1), [51], and a Jordan product through the correspondence
with the quadratic formulation of Jordan algebras.
Still in the case of e8 (e(n)
8 for n = 1), if we identify the e8 generators corresponding to
the roots in ΦO with the bosons and those corresponding to the roots in Φ S with the fermions,
then the 11 bosons in T are k1±kj, j = 4,..., 8 and−k2−k3. The three bosons k1±k8 and
−k2−k3, correspond to the three diagonal idempotents xP 1,xP 2,xP 3, which are left invariant
by d4, whose roots are ±ki±kj , 4≤i<j ≤ 7.
The remaining 8 vectors (bosons) and the 2x8 spinors (fermions) are linked by triality. No-
tice that one spinor has 1
2(k1− k2− k3 + k8) ﬁxed and even number of + signs among
±k4±k5±k6±k7, while the other one has 1
2(k1−k2−k3−k8) ﬁxed and odd number of
+ signs among±k4±k5±k6±k7. So they are both 8 dimensional representations of d4.
Therefore a generic element ofJ8
3 is a linear superposition of 3 diagonal elements plus one vector
and two spinors (or a bispinor). The vector can be viewed as the (12) octonionic entry of the
13

--- page 15 ---
matrix (plus its octonionic conjugate in the (21) position) and the two 8-dimensional spinors as
the (31) and (23) entry (plus their respective octonionic conjugate in the (31) and (23) position).
We do the same for n≥ 1 and consider the most general case e(n)
8 (the other two cases e(n)
6
and e(n)
7 being a restriction of it).
Let us deﬁnexP 1,xP 2 andxP 3 as the elements ofLMS inT associated to the rootsρ1 :=k1+kN,
ρ2 :=k1−kN and ρ3 :=−k2−k3:
xP 1↔ρ1 :=k1 +kN ; xP 2↔ρ2 :=k1−kN ; xP 3↔ρ3 :=−k2−k3 (6.1)
They are left invariant by the Lie subalgebra dN−4 = d4n, whose roots are ±ki±kj , 4≤i<
j≤N− 1.
We denote byTO the set of roots in T∩ ΦO, by T′
O the set of roots in TO that are not ρ1,ρ 2,ρ 3
and by TS the set of roots in T∩ ΦS. In the case we are considering, where T =T(1,1) we have
T′
O ={k1±kj, j = 4,...,N − 1} and TS ={ 1
2(k1−k2−k3±k4±...±kN)}, even # of +. We
further splitTS intoT +
S ={ 1
2(k1−k2−k3±k4±...+kN)} andT−
S ={ 1
2(k1−k2−k3±k4±...−kN)}.
Then v∈T′
O is an 8n-dimensional vector and s±∈T±
S are 24n−1-dimensional spinors of d4n.
We write a generic element x of T as x =∑λixPi + xv + xs+ +xs− where
xv =
∑
α∈T′
O
λv
αxα (6.2)
xs± =
∑
α∈T±
S
λs±
α xα (6.3)
We view λv
α as a coordinate of the vector λv and λs±
α as a coordinate of the spinor λs±
;
we denote by ¯λv (¯λs±
) the vectors ( spinor) in the dual space with respect to the appropriate
bilinear form and view x as a 3× 3 Hermitean matrix:


λ1 λv ¯λs+
¯λv λ2 λs−
λs+ ¯λs− λ3

 (6.4)
whose entries have the following F-dimensions:
• 1 for the scalar diagonal elements λ1,λ 2,λ 3;
• 8n for the vectorλv;
• 24n−1 for the spinors λs±.
We see that only forn = 1 the dimension of the vector and the spinors is the same, whereas
for n > 1 the entries in the (12) , (21) position have diﬀerent dimension than those in the
(31), (13), (23), (32) position. Nevertheless we now deﬁne a symmetric product of the elements
in T , which then becomes a generalization of the Jordan algebra J8
3 in a very precise sense.
This type of generalization of the Jordan Algebra is known in the literature, [44], where it is
called T−algebra.
We denote byI the elementI :=xP 1 +xP 2 +xP 3 and byI− the elementI− :=−¯xP 1− ¯xP 2−
¯xP 3 of ¯T :=T(−1,−1), where ¯xP 1, ¯xP 2 and ¯xP 3 are associated to the roots −k1−kN,−k1 +kN
and k2 +k3.
We give T an algebraic structure by introducing the symmetric product, see Proposition
6.2:
x◦y := 1
2[[x,I−],y ] , x,y ∈T (6.5)
14

--- page 16 ---
We introduce the trace (see Proposition 6.2) tr(x)∈ F for x∈T in the following way:
for x =ℓ1xP 1 +ℓ2xP 2 +ℓ3xP 3 +
∑
α̸=ρ1,ρ2,ρ3
ℓαxα tr(x) =ℓ1 +ℓ2 +ℓ3 (6.6)
We denote by tr(x,y ) :=tr(x◦y) and by x2 :=x◦x. For each x∈T we deﬁne
x# =x2−tr(x)x− 1
2(tr(x2)−tr(x)2)I (6.7)
and we say that x is rank-1 if x# = 0. Notice that tr(x#) = − 1
2(tr(x2)−tr(x)2), therefore
x# = 0 implies x2 = tr(x)x: a rank-1 element of T is either a nilpotent or a multiple of a
primitive idempotent u∈T : u2 =u and tr(u) = 1.
Let us also introduce N(x)∈ F for x∈T in the following way:
N(x) = 1
6
{
tr(x)3− 3tr(x)tr(x2) + 2tr(x3)
}
= 1
3tr(x#,x ) (6.8)
where x2 =x◦x and x3 =x◦x2.
Since by (6.8) a rank-1 element x has N(x) = 0 any element of T falls into the following
classiﬁcation:
rank-1: x# = 0
rank-2: x#̸= 0 , N(x) = 0
rank-3: N(x)̸= 0
(6.9)
Examples of rank-2 and rank-3 elements are xP 1 +xP 2 and I respectively.
We ﬁnally now show the main properties of the algebra T .
Proposition 6.1. Letx,y∈T then [[x,I−],y ] + [[I−,y ],x ] = 0.
Proof. By the linearity it is suﬃcient to prove the proposition for basis elementsX0∈{ ¯xP 1, ¯xP 2, ¯xP 3}
and basis elements X1,X 2 of T and the statement of the Proposition amounts to J0 +J2 = 0,
with J0 := [[X0,X 1],X 2] and J2 := [[X2,X 0],X 1] Set X0 = xα, α∈ {−k1±kN,k 2 +k3},
X1 =xβ,X2 =xγ. Since X1,X 2∈T then [X1,X 2] = 0 and β +γ /∈ Φ∪{ 0}; we also have that
α̸=β,α ̸=γ.
If none of the sums α +β, α +γ is in Φ nor is 0, then J0 +J2 = 0. Also if β = γ then
J0 +J2 = 0 is trivially satisﬁed.
From now on at least one of α +β,α +γ, is in Φ∪{ 0}. Suppose ﬁrst that α +β = 0. Then
J0 =−(γ,α )xγ and we have the following possibilities:
a1) if α +γ = 0 then β =γ and J0 +J2 = 0 becomes trivial;
a2) if α+γ∈ Φ then (γ,α ) =−1 by Proposition 4.4 andJ0 =xγ; moreoverJ2 =ε(γ,α )ε(α+
γ,−α)xγ =ε(α,−α)xγ =−xγ (because of Propositions 5.2 and 5.3) and J0 +J2 = 0 is
veriﬁed;
a3) if both α±γ /∈ Φ∪{ 0} then (α,γ ) = 0, by Proposition 4.4 being α ∈ ΦO, hence
J0 =J2 = 0.
15

--- page 17 ---
Similarly if we suppose α +γ = 0.
From now on α,β,γ ∈ Φ, α̸=±β̸=±γ̸=±α and α +β +γ∈ Φ (notice that α +β +γ
cannot be zero forα∈T(−1,−1) andβ,γ ∈T(1,1) and ifα+β+γ /∈ Φ then obviouslyJ0 =J2 = 0).
If none ofα+β,α +γ is in Φ thenJ0 =J2 = 0. If α+β∈ Φ then alsoα+γ∈ Φ (and vicev-
ersa): if γ∈ ΦO then, by Proposition 4.4, (α +β,γ ) =−1 = (α,γ ) + (β,γ ) = (α,γ ), implying
α+γ∈ Φ; ifβ∈ ΦO andγ∈ ΦS then (β,γ )∈{ 0, 1} and (α+β,γ ) =−1 = (α,γ )+(β,γ ) implies
(α,γ ) =−1 and (β,γ ) = 0; ifβ,γ ∈ ΦS then (α+β)∈ ΦS and (α+β,γ ) =−n = (α,γ )+(β,γ ),
with (α,γ )∈{ 0,±1} since α∈ Φ0. But ( α,γ ) = 0 implies β +γ∈ Φ and (α,γ ) = 1 implies
(β,γ ) =−(n + 1) hence β =−γ which both contraddict the hypothesis. Hence ( α,γ ) =−1
and α +γ∈ Φ.
Finally, ifα +β,α +γ∈ Φ then
[[xα,xβ],xγ] + [[xγ,xα],xβ] =
−ε(α,β )ε(γ,α )ε(β,γ ) +ε(γ,α )ε(γ,β )ε(α,β ) =ε(α,β )ε(γ,α )(ε(γ,β )−ε(β,γ )) (6.10)
Byiv) of Proposition5.2 plus Proposition 4.4 and (4.7) we haveε(β,γ )ε(γ,β ) = (−1)(β,γ)−mNnN(n−1).
If β∈ ΦO or γ∈ ΦO then ε(β,γ )ε(γ,β ) = (−1)(β,γ) and (β,γ )∈{ 0, 1}. Suppose ( β,γ ) = 1.
Then either α +γ∈ ΦO orβ∈ ΦO and (α +γ,β ) =−1; but also (α +γ,β ) = (α,β ) + (γ,β ) =
−1 + 1 = 0, a contraddiction. If both β,γ ∈ ΦS then (α +γ,β ) =−n and (α,β ) =−1. So
(β,γ ) =−(n− 1) and ε(β,γ )ε(γ,β ) = (−1)(β,γ)−mNnN(n−1) = (−1)−(n−1)±(n−1) = 1, therefore
ε(β,γ ) =ε(γ,β ) and (6.10) is zero.
This ends the proof of Proposition 6.1.
Proposition 6.2. The product x,y → x◦y is symmetric. With respect to this product the
element I∈ T is the identity and the elements xP 1,xP 2,xP 3∈ T are trace-one idempotents,
hence are rank-1 elements of T . All xα∈ T but xP 1,xP 2,xP 3 are nilpotent and trace-0, hence
they are also rank-1 elements of T . The form x→ tr(x) is a trace form, namely tr(x,y ) is
bilinear and symmetric in x,y and the associative property tr(x◦y,z ) = tr(x,y◦z) holds for
every x,y,z ∈T .
Proof. By Proposition 6.1:
[[x,I−],y ] + [[I−,y ],x ] = 0 ⇒ [[x,I−],y ] = [[y,I−],x ] ⇒ x◦y =y◦x (6.11)
We also have
[xPi,−¯xPj ] =δijhρi , i,j = 1, 2, 3 (6.12)
and for any α∈T(r,s), being ρ1 +ρ2 +ρ3 = 2k1−k2−k3:
I◦xα = 1
2[[I,I−],xα] = 1
2[hρ1 +hρ2 +hρ3,xα] = 1
2(ρ1 +ρ2 +ρ3,α )xα =xα (6.13)
By linearity this extends to any x∈T .
Moreover:
xPi◦xPi = 1
2[[xPi,I−],xPi ] = 1
2[hρi,xPi ] = 1
2(ρi,ρi)xPi =xPi (6.14)
Obviouslytr(xP 1) =tr(xP 2) =tr(xP 3) = 1.
We now show that xα∈T is nilpotent if α̸=k1±kN,−k2−k3.
Supposexα◦xα̸= 0 then either 2α−k1−kN or 2α−k1 +kN or 2α+k2 +k3 is a root. If α∈ ΦO
then 2α−k1∓kN =k1± 2ki∓kN is a root if and only if ki =kN, whereas 2α +k2 +k3 is not a
root. If α∈ ΦS then nor 2α−k1∓kN nor 2α+k2+k3 are roots. Therefore α̸=k1±kN,−k2−k3
implies x2
α = 0 and, obviously, tr(xα) = 0 and xα be rank-1.
Finally, from the deﬁnition of the product x,y→x◦y and the deﬁnition of the trace it easily
follows thattr(x,y ) is bilinear. The associativity of the trace is proven by direct calculation.

7 Future Developments
There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.
“Hamlet” 1.5.167-8, W. Shakespeare
We have presented a periodic inﬁnite chain of ﬁnite generalisations of the exceptional struc-
tures, including e8, the exceptional Jordan algebra JO
3 (and pair), and the octonions. We have
demonstrated that the exceptional Jordan algebra JO
3 is part of an inﬁnite family of ﬁnite-
dimensional matrix algebras (corresponding to a particular class of Vinberg’s cubic T-algebras
[44]). Correspondingly, we have proved that e8 is part of an inﬁnite family of MS algebras,
that resemble lattice vertex algebras.
We are currently working on several topics concerning the mathematical structure presented
in this paper. Many of them are at an advanced stage, some are completed. In particular we
will expand in future papers on the algebra of derivations of the algebras LMS and T , the
lattice, the modular forms and the theta functions related to EP.
There are also several topics that we are planning to develop in the future, strictly related to
Quantum Gravity. In particular, a model for interactions based on EP which includes gravity
and the expansion of space-time, starting from a singularity. We aim at a new perspective of
elementary particle physics at the early stages of the Universe based on the idea that inter-
actions, deﬁned in a purely algebraic way, are the fundamental objects of the theory, whereas
space-time, hence gravity, are derived structures.
An interesting venue of research stemming from EP is to study the higher dimensional weight
vectors of algebras akin to lattice vertex algebras (the original motivation for Borcherds’ deﬁ-
nition of vertex algebras [62]), that project to a “Magic Star” structure. Such extended “Magic
Star” algebras make use of an asymmetry function [60, 59], that acts like the cocycle of a lattice
vertex algebra which gives a twisted group ringCϵ[Λ] over an even lattice Λ. This gives algebras
that span higher dimensional lattices, beyond that of the self-dual D = 8 lattice of e8, and
allows one to potentially probe the symmetries of the heterotic string and moonshine [63, 64],
as well as to formulate a T -algebra generalization of noncommutative geometry. Speciﬁcally,
EP gives a novel algebraic method to study even self-dual lattices, such as the e8⊕ e8 and
Leech lattices, which already have a well known connection to the Monster vertex algebra and
D = 24 bosonic string compactiﬁcations [65, 66, 67].
With an inﬁnite family of new algebras that extend the exceptional Lie algebras, EP gives a
fresh new toolkit for studying emergent spacetime and quantum gravity, in dimensions beyond
those previously explored, using spectral techniques applied to an inﬁnite class of cubic T -
algebras.
An interaction based approach might also have a Yang-Mills interpretation, as EP hints at
higher-dimensional (possibly super) Yang-Mills theories (see e.g. [68]), that may exhibit some
kind of triality.
As the exceptional Jordan algebra JO
3 is to e8, so is the particular inﬁnite class of cubic
T-algebras to the higher EP algebras, when projected along an a2. Therefore, physically, the
class of cubic T-algebras under consideration allows one to consistently generalize exceptional
quantum mechanics of Jordan, Wigner and von Neumann [2], because they go beyond the
formally real Jordan algebraic classiﬁcation of quantum-mechanical self-adjoint operators; in a
sense, the classiﬁcation of quantum-mechanical observables can only probe the T-algebras up
to the exceptional Jordan algebra.
17

It is the authors’ hope that a synthesis of spectral algebraic geometry and EP can unify
many approaches to uniﬁcation and quantum gravity, and provide a new lens for searching a
non-perturbative theory of all matter, forces and spacetime.
