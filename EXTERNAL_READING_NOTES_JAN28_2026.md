# External Reading Notes (Jan 28, 2026)

This note captures key takeaways from three newly added PDFs and connects them
to the W33/E8 program. (External sources used for verification are listed in
the assistant response; this file keeps the notes compact.)

## 1) On Possible Embeddings of the Standard Models of Particle Physics and Gravity in E8 (2024)
Local PDF: `ON POSSIBLE EMBEDDINGS OF THE STANDARD MODELS OF PARTICLE PHYSICS AND GRAVITY IN E8 2024.pdf`

Core idea: explore E8 under the subgroup A1 + G2 + C3 in the real form E8(-24),
with a path that recovers SM SU(3) and a gravitational sector via SL4(R) acting
on phase space. The paper highlights a route from G2 -> SU(3), and from C3
to SU(3,3) -> SO(3,3) -> SL4(R), with geometric tensors emerging in the action
of SL4(R) on E8.

Online access (cross-check): arXiv listing 2404.18938 and an online summary exist.

Key statements (from PDF text):
- E8(-24) supports a decomposition into compact G2 plus split A1 + C3.
- Restricting G2 to SU(3) (strong force) and split SL2(R) is proposed as a
  symmetry-breaking mechanism for the weak sector.
- The C3 factor contains copies of SL2(C) (Lorentz) and extends to A5 in the
  real form SU(3,3) acting on complex phase space.
- SU(3,3) -> SO(3,3) corresponds to SL4(R) acting on phase space; this action
  yields tensors equivalent to stress-energy, Ricci, and Riemann, embedding GR.

Potential connections:
- Our W33 structure lives naturally in Sp(4,3) and the SL4(R) real form appears
  as a symmetry of (3+3)-dimensional phase space in the paper’s chain.
- The E8(-24) real form and the A1+G2+C3 embedding provide a concrete real-form
  context for W33-to-E8 embeddings.

## 2) The Magic Star of Exceptional Periodicity (2017)
Local PDF: `The Magic Star of Exceptional Periodicity 2017.pdf`

Core idea: exceptional periodicity (EP) extends E8 and Jordan structures into a
periodic family of finite-dimensional algebras; the “Magic Star” projection
makes Jordan-pair structure manifest in E8. The EP algebras are finite but no
longer Lie (Jacobi fails in general), with a lattice-like extended root system.
The work is published as a J. Phys.: Conf. Ser. paper based on arXiv:1711.07881.

Online access (cross-check): arXiv:1711.07881 and conference proceedings online.

Key statements (from PDF text):
- The Magic Star projection of E8 under A2 makes a triple of Jordan pairs
  visible at the six inner vertices.
- E8 can be described as 4 orthogonal A2 subalgebras plus 3 Jordan pairs.
- EP introduces “extended roots” and yields finite-dimensional algebras that
  generally fail the Jacobi identity (non‑Lie) but preserve Magic‑Star structure.
- At each EP level, the Jordan algebra role is generalized to Vinberg T‑algebras.

Potential connections:
- The Magic Star’s Jordan-pair structure dovetails with our H27/Schlaefli
  subsystem and the six Schlaefli copies we’ve identified in the 27-sector.
- EP’s extended roots resonate with our Schlaefli identification inside E8,
  suggesting a geometric “EP layer” for the W33 edge/root map.

Related:
- Geometry of exceptional super Yang-Mills theories uses the Magic Star
  projection of E8(-24), tying EP to higher-dimensional SYM.

## 3) Warm Dark Matter from Higher-Dimensional Gauge Theories (2021)
Local PDF: `Warm_Dark_Matter_from_Higher-Dimensional_Gauge_The.pdf`

Core idea: WDM models with high decoupling d.o.f. are motivated by large gauge
representations; in EP/brane setups (D=27+3), the authors identify a model with
2048 fermionic d.o.f., giving ~2 keV dark matter mass, while preserving SM
representations.

Online access (cross-check): Universe (MDPI) 2021, 7, 462.

Key statements (from PDF text):
- The model uses intersecting branes in D=27+3, isolating SM and WDM sectors.
- 2048 fermionic degrees of freedom are associated with the dark sector, giving
  ~2 keV WDM mass in the cited thermal relic framework.
- The construction uses EP superalgebras and large spinor representations;
  a concrete 11‑brane / 19‑brane intersection yields the 3‑brane spacetime.

Potential connections:
- Our W33 theory already predicts Ω_DM/Ω_b ≈ 27/5; a 2048-d.o.f. WDM sector is
  a candidate external cross-check to reconcile large d.o.f. with the finite
  geometry sector.
- The D=27+3 EP framework is thematically aligned with the Magic Star and EP
  context above, providing a possible physical realization for our discrete
  geometric sectors.

## 4) Schlaefli Graph References (for cross-checks)
We now have a concrete Schlaefli embedding in the balanced 27-orbit. The
standard SRG parameters (27,16,10,8) and Schlaefli properties match the
external references used in the assistant response.
